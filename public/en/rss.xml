      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new major Captain Tsubasa game is on the way, and the first official reveal already points to a much bigger scope than many fans expected. <code>Captain Tsubasa 2: World Fighters</code> is being presented as a high-energy arcade soccer experience with a strong anime identity and a large playable roster.</p>
<p>In this article, I separate confirmed details from early assumptions, using the official Bandai Namco page as the primary source and the community wiki as a secondary tracking reference.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🌟 Why This Announcement Matters</h2>
<p>What makes this announcement notable is not only the sequel label, but the scale implied by the official messaging: broader platform reach, a larger cast, and a stronger emphasis on cinematic match presentation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Official page already lists a <code>2026</code> release window</li>
<li>Platform coverage includes console + PC (<code>Steam</code>)</li>
<li>The reveal messaging emphasizes scale: teams, characters, and cinematic cutscenes</li>
<li>Gameplay wording suggests a deeper on-field action system rather than a simple roster refresh</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>📋 Prerequisites</h2>
<p>This breakdown is written for readers who already know the <code>Captain Tsubasa</code> anime/manga universe and want a clean, decision-friendly snapshot of what is confirmed today.</p>
<ul>
<li>Familiarity with arcade football / anime sports game design</li>
<li>Interest in launch-platform planning (<code>PS5</code>, <code>Xbox Series X|S</code>, <code>Switch</code>, <code>PC</code>)</li>
<li>Expectation that early announcement pages may still change before release</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Official Facts</h2>
<p>Start with the official Bandai Namco page. At this stage, it is the most reliable source for release-window, platform, and publisher-facing metadata.</p>
<p>Source links:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.bandainamcoent.com/games/captain-tsubasa-2-world-fighters">Bandai Namco - CAPTAIN TSUBASA 2: WORLD FIGHTERS</a></li>
<li><a href="https://captaintsubasa.fandom.com/wiki/Captain_Tsubasa_2:_World_Fighters">Captain Tsubasa Fandom Wiki page</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/oXf50MRXfM8">Announcement Trailer (YouTube)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Confirmed on the official page:</p>
<ul>
<li>Title: <code>CAPTAIN TSUBASA 2: WORLD FIGHTERS</code></li>
<li>Release window: <code>2026</code></li>
<li>Developer listed: <code>Tamsoft Corporation</code></li>
<li>Genre listing: <code>Sport (Arcade)</code></li>
<li>Feature tag shown: <code>Single-player</code></li>
<li>Platforms shown: <code>PlayStation 5</code>, <code>Xbox Series X|S</code>, <code>Steam</code>, <code>Nintendo Switch</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The page also includes wishlist/store entry points, media assets, and a news card tied to the reveal announcement dated <code>February 5, 2026</code>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Gameplay Pitch</h2>
<p>Even without a full gameplay breakdown, the wording on the official page is enough to outline the intended player experience.</p>
<p>The official overview highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>22 national teams</code></li>
<li><code>110+ playable characters</code></li>
<li>A “super action soccer” style with constant superhuman plays</li>
</ul>
<p>The feature section adds more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>150+</code> cutscenes/move highlights on the pitch</li>
<li>New and improved on-field action for passing, dribbling, tackling, and blocking</li>
<li>A new goalkeeper-versus-shooter interaction system for super shots and blocks</li>
</ul>
<p>Taken together, these points suggest a cinematic arcade formula that leans into anime spectacle while adding more structured shot-versus-save moments.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Community References</h2>
<p>The Fandom page is useful as a fast-moving reference hub, but it should still be treated as a secondary source until the official site and storefront pages publish fuller details.</p>
<p>As of <code>February 26, 2026</code>, the Fandom page is helpful for tracking updates, but several areas still appear to be in-progress:</p>
<ul>
<li>Story section placeholders are still being filled</li>
<li>Team listings exist, but coverage may be incomplete</li>
<li>Gallery/media and metadata sections can update quickly after trailers/news drops</li>
</ul>
<p>That is normal for a newly announced title. Use the wiki to monitor changes, but verify release-critical details against official sources before making purchase assumptions.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🧪 Key Unknowns</h2>
<p>Reveal pages usually lock in the marketing pitch first, while the most purchase-relevant details arrive later. These are the key items to watch next.</p>
<ul>
<li>Exact release date (official page currently shows <code>2026</code> only)</li>
<li>Full mode list (single-player is listed, but online/local modes need explicit confirmation)</li>
<li>Pricing and edition breakdowns by platform/store</li>
<li>Performance targets on <code>Switch</code> vs <code>PS5/Xbox Series X|S/PC</code></li>
<li>Monetization details (the official page already shows ESRB interactive notice for <code>In-Game Purchases</code>)</li>
<li>Region-specific availability and language support</li>
</ul>
<p>The official page also lists ESRB-related descriptors such as <code>Mild Violence</code> and <code>Mild Language</code>, which helps set early expectations for the U.S. rating context.</p>
<hr>
<h2>▶️ Tracking Updates</h2>
<p>If you want to stay updated without chasing every rumor, this order keeps the signal-to-noise ratio high:</p>
<ol>
<li>Official Bandai Namco game page for platform and release metadata changes</li>
<li>Official trailers/media on the game page and store pages</li>
<li>Community wiki/Fandom page for aggregated roster/team/story references</li>
<li>Store pages (<code>Steam</code>, console storefronts) for pricing, edition, and system requirement updates</li>
</ol>
<p>If you plan to buy at launch, wishlist the game on your preferred platform and re-check the official page after each trailer or news drop.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🎬 Media</h2>
<p>This media section is split into two parts so you can quickly check the official trailer first, then browse the visual gallery snapshots.</p>

<h2>🏁 Conclusion</h2>
<p>Based on the current reveal materials, <code>Captain Tsubasa 2: World Fighters</code> looks like a significantly bigger anime arcade football release with broad platform coverage, a large roster, and a more cinematic gameplay pitch. The practical next step is to track the official Bandai Namco page for the exact release date and full mode breakdown before choosing a launch platform.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://suaybsimsek.com/en/posts/captain-tsubasa-rise-of-new-champions</guid>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Before <code>Captain Tsubasa 2: World Fighters</code> arrives, <code>Captain Tsubasa: Rise of New Champions</code> remains the modern reference point for what a big-budget Captain Tsubasa console game looks like. It is still the clearest example of how Bandai Namco and Tamsoft translated the series into fast, spectacle-first arcade football.</p>
<p>This article looks at the game from a current editorial angle: what was officially confirmed at launch, what the edition and DLC structure tells us, and why the game still matters if you are revisiting the series today.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🌟 Why This Game Still Matters</h2>
<p><code>Rise of New Champions</code> was positioned as the first new Captain Tsubasa console game in roughly a decade, and that context still matters. It set the template that later discussions around the franchise continue to reference: anime-faithful presentation, exaggerated super plays, and a clear preference for arcade speed over simulation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Official release date on the Bandai Namco Europe page is <code>August 28, 2020</code></li>
<li>The official page lists <code>TAMSOFT</code> as developer and <code>Arcade</code> as the genre label</li>
<li>Platform listing on the official page covers <code>PlayStation 4</code>, <code>Nintendo Switch</code>, and <code>Steam</code></li>
<li>The current official page still reflects a sizable edition and DLC footprint, which makes it a useful baseline when comparing later Captain Tsubasa releases</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>📋 Prerequisites</h2>
<p>This breakdown is written for readers who want a practical picture of <code>Rise of New Champions</code> today, not just a launch-day recap.</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic familiarity with the <code>Captain Tsubasa</code> anime/manga universe</li>
<li>Interest in anime-styled arcade football rather than realistic football simulation</li>
<li>Willingness to check edition/store details carefully, because this game’s content rollout extended beyond the base launch package</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Official Facts</h2>
<p>Start with the Bandai Namco Europe page. For release date, platform support, and official product framing, it remains the cleanest primary source.</p>
<p>Source links:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/captain-tsubasa/captain-tsubasa-rise-of-new-champions">Bandai Namco Europe - CAPTAIN TSUBASA: RISE OF NEW CHAMPIONS</a></li>
<li><a href="https://captaintsubasa.fandom.com/wiki/Captain_Tsubasa:_Rise_of_New_Champions">Captain Tsubasa Fandom Wiki page</a></li>
<li><a href="https://captaintsubasa.fandom.com/wiki/Captain_Tsubasa:_Rise_of_New_Champions/Gallery#Art">Fandom Art gallery</a></li>
<li><a href="https://captaintsubasa.fandom.com/wiki/Captain_Tsubasa:_Rise_of_New_Champions/Gallery#Japan">Fandom Japan gallery reference</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/WHBQO6tH4Dk">Official trailer embed on Bandai page (YouTube)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Confirmed on the official page:</p>
<ul>
<li>Title: <code>CAPTAIN TSUBASA: RISE OF NEW CHAMPIONS</code></li>
<li>Release date: <code>28/08/2020</code></li>
<li>Developer: <code>TAMSOFT</code></li>
<li>Genre: <code>Arcade</code></li>
<li>Platforms shown: <code>PlayStation 4</code>, <code>Nintendo Switch</code>, <code>Steam</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The official description also frames the game as the series’ return to consoles after roughly ten years, with an explicit promise of anime spectacle and up-to-date presentation.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Gameplay Pitch</h2>
<p>The official key-features section makes the game’s direction very clear: this is not a grounded football sim. It is an anime football action game built around visual impact and fast exchanges.</p>
<p>The official page emphasizes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Toon shading combined with more realistic effects</li>
<li>Detailed presentation for signature character styles</li>
<li>High-speed “arcade football action”</li>
<li>Simple controls designed to make special moves and highlight plays accessible</li>
</ul>
<p>That framing is important because it explains both the game’s appeal and its limits. If you want structured, sim-like football, this is the wrong entry point. If you want exaggerated shots, tackles, rivalries, and momentum swings that feel close to the anime, this is exactly the lane the game targets.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Editions and DLC</h2>
<p>One of the most practical things about the current official page is that it still exposes how much post-launch content was attached to the game.</p>
<p>The page shows multiple editions and related content references, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Champions Edition</code></li>
<li><code>Collector's Edition</code></li>
<li><code>Deluxe Edition</code></li>
<li><code>Legends Edition</code></li>
<li><code>New Hero Edition</code></li>
<li><code>Character Pass: 9 DLC players</code></li>
<li><code>Season Pass Bonus: New Champions Uniform Set</code></li>
<li><code>Deluxe Edition Bonus: V Jump Collaboration Uniform Set</code></li>
</ul>
<p>From a player’s perspective, this matters more than marketing nostalgia. If you are buying or replaying the game now, edition structure directly affects how much roster-related and cosmetic content you actually receive.</p>
<p>The official page also still surfaces later DLC/news references such as <code>EPISODE: RISING STARS</code>, which shows that the game’s support window expanded well beyond the base launch moment.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Community References</h2>
<p>The Fandom page is still useful, especially when you want a single place for roster references, story structure summaries, and archived promotional art. That includes the <code>Art</code> and <code>Japan</code> gallery sections, which are useful visual references when official media blocks rotate over time.</p>
<p>Use it for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aggregated roster/team references</li>
<li>Story-mode and character reference browsing</li>
<li>Archived gallery snapshots and regional cover/art references</li>
</ul>
<p>Use official sources first for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Release date and platform confirmation</li>
<li>Edition/store metadata</li>
<li>Current DLC/storefront navigation</li>
</ul>
<p>The right split is simple: official pages for buying facts, community pages for context and archival browsing.</p>
<hr>
<h2>▶️ What to Verify Today</h2>
<p>Because this is a 2020 release with layered editions and DLC, the key questions today are not the same as they were at launch.</p>
<p>Check these points first:</p>
<ol>
<li>Which edition is actually available on your preferred platform today</li>
<li>Whether the <code>Character Pass</code> or later DLC content is bundled or separate</li>
<li>Whether you want the game mainly for arcade match play, series presentation, or collection value</li>
<li>Whether the platform you are considering (<code>PS4</code>, <code>Switch</code>, or <code>Steam</code>) is the one you actually want to play long-term</li>
</ol>
<p>If your goal is to understand the modern Captain Tsubasa console formula before <code>World Fighters</code>, this game still does that job well. If your goal is simply to own the most complete package, edition details matter enough that you should not treat storefront listings as interchangeable.</p>
<hr>

<h2>🏁 Conclusion</h2>
<p><code>Captain Tsubasa: Rise of New Champions</code> is still the clearest modern template for the franchise’s console direction before <code>World Fighters</code>: aggressive arcade pacing, anime-faithful spectacle, and a product structure shaped heavily by editions and DLC. If you are revisiting the series now, the smartest move is to verify edition contents first, then decide whether you want this game as a playable entry point, a collection piece, or a baseline for comparing the next Captain Tsubasa release.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://suaybsimsek.com/en/posts/spring-boot-configuration-properties</guid>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’ve ever ended up with a dozen <code>@Value</code> annotations and no idea which settings are required, <code>@ConfigurationProperties</code> is the Spring Boot way to make configuration type-safe, structured, and validatable.</p>
<p>In this post, you’ll learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to model configuration as a class (Java/Kotlin)</li>
<li>How to validate configuration at startup</li>
<li>How profile-specific config files (<code>application-{profile}.yml</code>) override defaults</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>🌟 Why <code>@ConfigurationProperties</code>?</h2>
<p>In this section, we clarify Why <code>@ConfigurationProperties</code>? and summarize the key points you will apply in implementation.</p>
<ul>
<li>✅ Type-safe access to config (IDE autocomplete, refactoring-safe)</li>
<li>✅ Group and document related settings under a single prefix</li>
<li>✅ Validate misconfigurations early (fail fast on startup)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>📋 Prerequisites</h2>
<p>In this section, we clarify Prerequisites and summarize the key points you will apply in implementation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Java 17+</li>
<li>Spring Boot 3.x</li>
<li>Maven or Gradle</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Step 1: Define configuration in <code>application.yml</code></h2>
<p>Create a namespace (prefix) for your app config, for example <code>app</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">app:
  security:
    enabled: true
    token-expiry-seconds: 3600
  allowed-origins:
    - 'https://example.com'
    - 'http://localhost:3000'

<h2>🛠️ Step 2: Create a <code>@ConfigurationProperties</code> class</h2>
<h3>Java</h3>
<pre><code class="language-java">import java.util.List;

import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties;

@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "app")
public class AppProperties {

  private Security security = new Security();
  private List&#x3C;String> allowedOrigins = List.of();

  public Security getSecurity() {
    return security;
  }

  public void setSecurity(Security security) {
    this.security = security;
  }

  public List&#x3C;String> getAllowedOrigins() {
    return allowedOrigins;
  }

  public void setAllowedOrigins(List&#x3C;String> allowedOrigins) {
    this.allowedOrigins = allowedOrigins;
  }

  public static class Security {
    private boolean enabled = true;
    private int tokenExpirySeconds = 3600;

    public boolean isEnabled() {
      return enabled;
    }

    public void setEnabled(boolean enabled) {
      this.enabled = enabled;
    }

    public int getTokenExpirySeconds() {
      return tokenExpirySeconds;
    }

    public void setTokenExpirySeconds(int tokenExpirySeconds) {
      this.tokenExpirySeconds = tokenExpirySeconds;
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Kotlin</h3>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties

@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "app")
data class AppProperties(
  val security: Security = Security(),
  val allowedOrigins: List&#x3C;String> = emptyList(),
) {
  data class Security(
    val enabled: Boolean = true,
    val tokenExpirySeconds: Int = 3600,
  )
}
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Step 3: Enable configuration properties</h2>
<p>You have two common options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Scan for <code>@ConfigurationProperties</code> types:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-java">import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationPropertiesScan;

@SpringBootApplication
@ConfigurationPropertiesScan
public class DemoApplication {}
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>Register specific classes explicitly:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-java">import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.EnableConfigurationProperties;

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableConfigurationProperties(AppProperties.class)
public class DemoApplication {}
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>🧪 Step 4: Validate properties at startup (fail fast)</h2>
<p>Add validation constraints and annotate the class with <code>@Validated</code>.</p>
<h3>Java</h3>
<pre><code class="language-java">import java.util.List;

import jakarta.validation.Valid;
import jakarta.validation.constraints.Min;
import jakarta.validation.constraints.NotEmpty;

import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties;
import org.springframework.validation.annotation.Validated;

@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "app")
@Validated
public class AppProperties {

  @Valid
  private Security security = new Security();

  @NotEmpty
  private List&#x3C;String> allowedOrigins = List.of();

  public Security getSecurity() { return security; }
  public void setSecurity(Security security) { this.security = security; }

  public List&#x3C;String> getAllowedOrigins() { return allowedOrigins; }
  public void setAllowedOrigins(List&#x3C;String> allowedOrigins) { this.allowedOrigins = allowedOrigins; }

  public static class Security {
    private boolean enabled = true;

    @Min(60)
    private int tokenExpirySeconds = 3600;

    public boolean isEnabled() { return enabled; }
    public void setEnabled(boolean enabled) { this.enabled = enabled; }

    public int getTokenExpirySeconds() { return tokenExpirySeconds; }
    public void setTokenExpirySeconds(int tokenExpirySeconds) { this.tokenExpirySeconds = tokenExpirySeconds; }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Kotlin</h3>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">import jakarta.validation.Valid
import jakarta.validation.constraints.Min
import jakarta.validation.constraints.NotEmpty
import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties
import org.springframework.validation.annotation.Validated

@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "app")
@Validated
data class AppProperties(
  @field:Valid
  val security: Security = Security(),

  @field:NotEmpty
  val allowedOrigins: List&#x3C;String> = emptyList(),
) {
  data class Security(
    val enabled: Boolean = true,

    @field:Min(60)
    val tokenExpirySeconds: Int = 3600,
  )
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note: you need a Bean Validation implementation on the classpath (e.g., <code>spring-boot-starter-validation</code>) for these constraints to be enforced.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Step 5: Use profile-specific files (<code>application-{profile}.yml</code>)</h2>
<p>Spring Boot loads <code>application.yml</code> and then applies profile-specific overrides.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>application.yml</code> (defaults)</li>
<li><code>application-prod.yml</code> (production overrides)</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-yaml"># application-prod.yml
app:
  security:
    enabled: true
  allowed-origins:
    - 'https://mycompany.com'
</code></pre>
<p>When multiple profiles are active, profile files are applied with a “last wins” strategy (the last active profile can override earlier ones).</p>
<hr>
<h2>🌟 Tips</h2>
<p>In this section, we clarify Tips and summarize the key points you will apply in implementation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Prefer <code>@ConfigurationProperties</code> over scattered <code>@Value</code> for anything non-trivial.</li>
<li>Keep a single <code>AppProperties</code> root per bounded domain (<code>security</code>, <code>mail</code>, <code>storage</code>, etc.).</li>
<li>Add validation constraints for anything that must not be empty or must be within a safe range.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>🏁 Conclusion</h2>
<p>You now have a type-safe Spring Boot configuration layer with startup validation and profile-based overrides. As a next step, externalize environment-specific secrets and add configuration tests to catch regressions early.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spring Boot GraphQL JWE Authentication combines the flexibility of GraphQL with stateless encrypted JWTs (JWE) and a JPA-backed user store to deliver a secure, scalable API.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🌟 Why Use GraphQL + JWE Authentication?</h2>
<p>In this section, we clarify Why Use GraphQL + JWE Authentication? and summarize the key points you will apply in implementation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stateless Security: Tokens are self-contained and require no server-side storage.</li>
<li>GraphQL Flexibility: Secure any query or mutation uniformly.</li>
<li>Data Precision: Fetch exactly what clients request.</li>
<li>Integrity: Signed tokens ensure tamper evidence.</li>
<li>Confidentiality: Encrypted JWTs hide sensitive claims.</li>
<li>Standards-based: Leverage JOSE, Spring Security, and GraphQL.</li>
<li>Scalable: Scale horizontally without session replication or sticky sessions.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>📋 Prerequisites</h2>
<p>In this section, we clarify Prerequisites and summarize the key points you will apply in implementation.</p>
<ul>
<li>☕ Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher</li>
<li>📦 Spring Boot 3.2+</li>
<li>🔤 IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)</li>
<li>🛢️ PostgreSQL (or H2 for dev)</li>

<h2>🛠️ Step 2: Configuration Files</h2>
<p>In this section, we define all of the application- and database-level configuration files required to wire up our Spring Boot app with H2/PostgreSQL, JPA, Liquibase changelogs, initial data loads, JWE key properties and GraphQL schema definitions, and GraalVM native-image reflection config.</p>
<ul>

<h2>🛠️ Step 3: GraphQL &#x26; Security &#x26; Database Configuration</h2>
<p>In this section, we define the beans and properties RSA keys, HTTP security filters, and JPA repository/auditing setup for JWE‑based authentication, GraalVM native-image runtime hints, GraphQL wiring and custom scalars:</p>
<ul>
<li>JwtProperties: Configures JWT issuer, expiration, and signing/encryption key pairs.</li>
<li>SecurityJwtConfig: Builds RSA keys and JWK sources; configures JWT encoder/decoder, authentication converter, token resolver, and WebSocket interceptor beans.</li>
<li>SecurityConfig: Integrates <code>DomainUserDetailsService</code>, configures authentication manager, password encoder, and stateless security filter chain with JWE support.</li>
<li>DatabaseConfig: Enables JPA repositories, auditing, and transaction management.</li>
<li>GraphQLConfig: Registers custom scalars for GraphQL (<code>Long</code>, <code>Date</code>, <code>Instant</code>).</li>
<li>InstantScalar: Defines an ISO-8601 <code>Instant</code> scalar for GraphQL.</li>
<li>NativeConfig: Registers runtime hints for GraalVM native-image, including reflection and resource patterns.</li>
</ul>

<h2>🛠️ Step 5: Secure JWE Token Utilities</h2>
<p>In this section, we define the core utility classes and constants needed to generate, encrypt, and resolve JSON Web Encryption (JWE) tokens in your Spring Boot application, integrate auditing, and implement a JPA-based user details service:</p>
<ul>
<li>AuthoritiesConstants: Centralize role names with the <code>ROLE_</code> prefix.</li>
<li>CookieBearerTokenResolver: Resolve bearer tokens from Authorization headers or HTTP cookies.</li>
<li>CookieUtils: Generates HTTP-only, secure <code>ResponseCookie</code> for new or expired tokens, and extracts the raw <code>accessToken</code> from <code>HttpHeaders</code></li>
<li>JweUtil: Sign (JWS) and encrypt (JWE) JWTs using RSA keys and Nimbus.</li>
<li>KeyUtils: Build RSA JWKs from PEM‐encoded key material.</li>
<li>SecurityUtils: Extract the current user’s login from the security context.</li>
<li>SpringSecurityAuditorAware: Implement <code>AuditorAware</code> to provide the current user for auditing.</li>
<li>DomainUserDetailsService: JPA-based <code>UserDetailsService</code> loading user and authorities for authentication.</li>
<li>GraphQlTokenCookieInterceptor: Intercepts GraphQL responses to set or clear the access token cookie based on <code>accessToken</code> and <code>clearAccessToken</code> flags in the <code>GraphQLContext</code>.</li>
<li>CookieAuthenticationWebSocketInterceptor: Intercept WebSocket connections to authenticate using JWE tokens from headers or cookies.</li>
</ul>
<p>These utilities form the foundation for a stateless, JWE‐based authentication flow in Spring Security.</p>

<h2>🛠️ Step 6: Authentication &#x26; Protected Endpoints</h2>
<p>In this section, we define the GraphQL controllers and DTOs necessary for:</p>
<ul>
<li>AuthController: Authenticates users, issues JWE tokens via a GraphQL mutation, and places <code>accessToken</code> or <code>clearAccessToken</code> flags into the GraphQLContext.</li>
<li>HelloController: Expose protected GraphQL queries, subscriptions and mutations for authenticated users and admin-only operations.</li>
<li>LoginInput: GraphQL input type for login (username/password).</li>
<li>GreetInput &#x26; GreetDTO: GraphQL mutation input and response for a greeting operation.</li>
<li>TokenDTO: Model the JWE token response including token, type, and expiration.</li>
</ul>
<p>These components complete the stateless authentication flow in a GraphQL API using JWE tokens and a JPA-backed user store.</p>
<p>AuthController</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spring Boot lets you use stateless encrypted JWTs (JWE) to secure your APIs, while persisting user identities and roles in a JPA-backed database.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🌟 Why Use JWE + JPA Authentication?</h2>
<p>In this section, we clarify Why Use JWE + JPA Authentication? and summarize the key points you will apply in implementation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stateless Security: Tokens are self-contained and require no server-side storage.</li>
<li>Integrity: Signed tokens ensure tamper evidence.</li>
<li>Confidentiality: Encrypted JWTs hide sensitive claims.</li>
<li>User Management: Persist and manage users and roles via familiar JPA repositories.</li>
<li>Standards-based: Leverage JOSE, Spring Security, and Spring Data JPA.</li>
<li>Scalable: Scale horizontally without session replication or sticky sessions.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>📋 Prerequisites</h2>
<p>In this section, we clarify Prerequisites and summarize the key points you will apply in implementation.</p>
<ul>
<li>☕ Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher</li>
<li>📦 Spring Boot 3.2+</li>
<li>🔤 IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)</li>
<li>🛢️ PostgreSQL (or H2 for dev)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Step 1: Add Dependencies</h2>
<p>Include these in your <code>pom.xml</code> or <code>build.gradle</code> file.</p>
<p>Maven:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&#x3C;dependency>
  &#x3C;groupId>org.springframework.boot&#x3C;/groupId>
  &#x3C;artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web&#x3C;/artifactId>
&#x3C;/dependency>
&#x3C;dependency>
  &#x3C;groupId>org.springframework.security&#x3C;/groupId>
  &#x3C;artifactId>spring-security-oauth2-resource-server&#x3C;/artifactId>
&#x3C;/dependency>
&#x3C;dependency>
  &#x3C;groupId>org.springframework.boot&#x3C;/groupId>
  &#x3C;artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-jpa&#x3C;/artifactId>
&#x3C;/dependency>
&#x3C;dependency>
  &#x3C;groupId>org.liquibase&#x3C;/groupId>
  &#x3C;artifactId>liquibase-core&#x3C;/artifactId>
&#x3C;/dependency>
&#x3C;dependency>
  &#x3C;groupId>org.projectlombok&#x3C;/groupId>
  &#x3C;artifactId>lombok&#x3C;/artifactId>
  &#x3C;optional>true&#x3C;/optional>
&#x3C;/dependency>
&#x3C;dependency>
  &#x3C;groupId>com.h2database&#x3C;/groupId>
  &#x3C;artifactId>h2&#x3C;/artifactId>
  &#x3C;scope>runtime&#x3C;/scope>
&#x3C;/dependency>
</code></pre>
<p>Gradle:</p>
<pre><code class="language-groovy">implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web'
implementation 'org.springframework.security:spring-security-oauth2-resource-server'
implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-data-jpa'
implementation 'org.liquibase:liquibase-core'
compileOnly 'org.projectlombok:lombok'
runtimeOnly 'com.h2database:h2'
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Step 2: Configuration Files</h2>
<p>In this section, we define all of the application- and database-level configuration files required to wire up our Spring Boot app with H2/PostgreSQL, JPA, Liquibase changelogs, initial data loads, and JWE key properties.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>application.yml</code>
Holds Spring datasource, H2 console, JPA/Hibernate, Liquibase changelog path, and all JWT/JWE key, issuer, and expiration settings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>db/master.xml</code>
The Liquibase master changelog, with includes and DBMS-specific properties for H2 and PostgreSQL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>db/changelog/changelog-user.xml</code>
Your core schema changelog defining <code>user_identity</code>, <code>authority</code>, and <code>user_authority_mapping</code> tables, indexes, FKs, and initial <code>&#x3C;loadData></code> steps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>db/data/user.csv</code>
Initial user records (UUID, username, bcrypt-hashed password, email, enabled flag, timestamps, auditor).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>db/data/authority.csv</code>
Initial authority records (UUID, name, description, timestamps, auditor).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>db/data/user_authority_mapping.csv</code>
Initial mapping of users ↔ authorities (composite PK, timestamps, auditor).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>application.yml</p>

<h2>🛠️ Step 3: Security &#x26; Database Configuration</h2>
<p>In this section, we define the beans and properties RSA keys, HTTP security filters, and JPA repository/auditing setup for JWE‑based authentication:</p>
<ul>
<li>JwtProperties: Configures JWT issuer, expiration, and signing/encryption key pairs.</li>
<li>SecurityJwtConfig: Builds RSA JWKs, JWT encoder/decoder, authentication converter, and token resolver.</li>
<li>SecurityConfig: Integrates <code>DomainUserDetailsService</code>, configures authentication manager, password encoder, and stateless security filter chain with JWE support.</li>
<li>DatabaseConfig: Enables JPA repositories, auditing, and transaction management.</li>

<h2>🛠️ Step 4: JPA Integration</h2>
<p>In this section, we define the JPA entities representing users, authorities, and their mappings, along with the Spring Data repository for loading users with their authorities.</p>
<ul>
<li>BaseEntity: Abstract superclass providing audit fields (<code>createdAt</code>, <code>createdBy</code>, <code>updatedAt</code>, <code>updatedBy</code>).</li>
<li>Authority: <code>authority</code> table entity storing role data.</li>
<li>User: <code>user_identity</code> table entity storing user credentials and profile.</li>
<li>UserAuthorityMapping: <code>user_authority_mapping</code> join table entity linking users and authorities.</li>
<li>UserAuthorityMappingId: Composite key class for <code>UserAuthorityMapping</code>.</li>
<li>UserRepository: Spring Data JPA repository for <code>User</code> with an entity graph to load authorities.</li>

<h2>🛠️ Step 5: Secure JWE Token Utilities</h2>
<p>In this section, we define the core utility classes and constants needed to generate, encrypt, and resolve JSON Web Encryption (JWE) tokens in your Spring Boot application, integrate auditing, and implement a JPA-based user details service:</p>
<ul>
<li>AuthoritiesConstants: Centralize role names with the <code>ROLE_</code> prefix.</li>
<li>CookieBearerTokenResolver: Resolve bearer tokens from Authorization headers or HTTP cookies.</li>
<li>CookieUtils: Create HTTP-only, secure cookies for access tokens.</li>
<li>JweUtil: Sign (JWS) and encrypt (JWE) JWTs using RSA keys and Nimbus.</li>
<li>KeyUtils: Build RSA JWKs from PEM‐encoded key material.</li>
<li>SecurityUtils: Extract the current user’s login from the security context.</li>
<li>SpringSecurityAuditorAware: Implement <code>AuditorAware</code> to provide the current user for auditing.</li>
<li>DomainUserDetailsService: JPA-based <code>UserDetailsService</code> loading user and authorities for authentication.</li>
</ul>
<p>These utilities form the foundation for a stateless, JWE‐based authentication flow in Spring Security.</p>

<h2>🛠️ Step 6: Authentication &#x26; Protected Endpoints</h2>
<p>In this section, we define the REST controllers and DTOs necessary for:</p>
<ul>
<li>AuthController: Authenticate users, issue JWE tokens, and set secure cookies.</li>
<li>HelloController: Expose protected resource endpoints for authenticated users and admin-specific paths.</li>
<li>LoginRequestDTO: Model the login request payload (username/password).</li>
<li>TokenDTO: Model the authentication response including token and expiration.</li>
</ul>
<p>These components complete the stateless authentication flow by handling login, token issuance, cookie management, and resource protection.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spring Boot lets you combine LDAP authentication with JWE-encrypted JWTs to secure your Spring Boot APIs with both external directory integration and token confidentiality.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🌟 Why Combine LDAP &#x26; JWE?</h2>
<p>In this section, we clarify Why Combine LDAP &#x26; JWE? and summarize the key points you will apply in implementation.</p>
<ul>
<li>External Directory: Centralize user management with LDAP (e.g., corporate or embedded directory).</li>
<li>Integrity &#x26; Confidentiality: Sign tokens (JWS) and encrypt payloads (JWE) for secure claims transport.</li>
<li>Standards-based: Leverage JOSE (JWS &#x26; JWE) and Spring Security’s OAuth2 Resource Server.</li>
<li>Role-based Access: Map LDAP groups to <code>ROLE_USER</code> / <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> automatically.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>📋 Prerequisites</h2>
<p>In this section, we clarify Prerequisites and summarize the key points you will apply in implementation.</p>
<ul>
<li>☕ Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher</li>
<li>📦 Spring Boot 3.2+</li>
<li>🗄️ LDAP (Embedded via Spring Boot or external)</li>
<li>🔤 IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)</li>
</ul>

<p>This combined configuration ensures your application boots an embedded LDAP server with the defined schema, and loads RSA keys for JWE signing and encryption. You can now proceed to configure Spring Security to use LDAP for authentication and JWE for token issuance.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Step 3: Security Configuration</h2>
<p>In this section, we define the beans and properties configure LDAP authentication, set up RSA keys, and enforce HTTP security filters for a JWE-based authentication:</p>

<h2>🛠️ Step 4: Secure JWE Token Utilities</h2>
<p>In this section, we define the core utility classes and constants needed to generate, encrypt, and resolve JSON Web Encryption (JWE) tokens in your Spring Boot application. These components work together to:</p>
<ul>
<li>AuthoritiesConstants: Centralize role names with the <code>ROLE_</code> prefix.</li>
<li>CookieBearerTokenResolver: Resolve bearer tokens from Authorization headers or HTTP cookies.</li>
<li>CookieUtils: Create HTTP-only, secure cookies for access tokens.</li>
<li>JweUtil: Sign (JWS) and encrypt (JWE) JWTs using RSA keys and Nimbus.</li>
<li>KeyUtils: Build RSA JWKs from PEM‐encoded key material.</li>
<li>SecurityUtils: Extract the current user’s login from the security context.</li>
</ul>
<p>These utilities form the foundation for a stateless, JWE‐based authentication flow in Spring Security.</p>
<p>AuthoritiesConstants</p>

<h2>🛠️ Step 5: Authentication &#x26; Protected Endpoints</h2>
<p>In this section, we define the REST controllers and DTOs necessary for:</p>
<ul>
<li>AuthController: Authenticate users, issue JWE tokens, and set secure cookies.</li>
<li>HelloController: Expose protected resource endpoints for authenticated users and admin-specific paths.</li>
<li>LoginRequestDTO: Model the login request payload (username/password).</li>
<li>TokenDTO: Model the authentication response including token and expiration.</li>
</ul>
<p>These components complete the stateless authentication flow by handling login, token issuance, cookie management, and resource protection.</p>
<p>In this section, we expose REST controllers and DTOs to handle user authentication, token issuance, and protected resource access.</p>

<p>Use cookie to access hello endpoint:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">curl -b "accessToken=&#x3C;jwe-token>" http://localhost:8080/api/hello
</code></pre>
<p>Use Authorization header instead:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">curl -H "Authorization: Bearer &#x3C;jwe-token>" http://localhost:8080/api/hello
</code></pre>
<p>Access admin-only endpoint:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">curl -H "Authorization: Bearer &#x3C;jwe-token>" http://localhost:8080/api/hello/admin
</code></pre>
<h3>User Flow</h3>
<p>Login as user and capture JWE token from cookie:</p>

<h2>🌟 Why Use JWE Authentication?</h2>
<p>In this section, we clarify Why Use JWE Authentication? and summarize the key points you will apply in implementation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Integrity: Ensure tokens are signed (JWS) and tamper-evident.</li>
<li>Confidentiality: Encrypt sensitive claims so only holders of the private key can read them (JWE).</li>
<li>Standards-based: Built on the JOSE (JWS, JWE) specifications.</li>
<li>Spring Support: Spring Security’s OAuth2 Resource Server handles JWE+JWS seamlessly.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>📋 Prerequisites</h2>
<p>In this section, we clarify Prerequisites and summarize the key points you will apply in implementation.</p>
<ul>
<li>☕ Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher</li>
<li>📦 Spring Boot 3.2+</li>
<li>🔤 IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)</li>
</ul>

<h2>🛠️ Step 4: Secure JWE Token Utilities</h2>
<p>In this section, we define the core utility classes and constants needed to generate, encrypt, and resolve JSON Web Encryption (JWE) tokens in your Spring Boot application. These components work together to:</p>
<ul>
<li>AuthoritiesConstants: Centralize role names with the <code>ROLE_</code> prefix.</li>
<li>CookieBearerTokenResolver: Resolve bearer tokens from Authorization headers or HTTP cookies.</li>
<li>CookieUtils: Create HTTP-only, secure cookies for access tokens.</li>
<li>JweUtil: Sign (JWS) and encrypt (JWE) JWTs using RSA keys and Nimbus.</li>
<li>KeyUtils: Build RSA JWKs from PEM‐encoded key material.</li>
<li>SecurityUtils: Extract the current user’s login from the security context.</li>
</ul>
<p>These utilities form the foundation for a stateless, JWE‐based authentication flow in Spring Security.</p>
<p>AuthoritiesConstants</p>

<h2>🛠️ Step 5: Authentication &#x26; Protected Endpoints</h2>
<p>In this section, we define the REST controllers and DTOs necessary for:</p>
<ul>
<li>AuthController: Authenticate users, issue JWE tokens, and set secure cookies.</li>
<li>HelloController: Expose protected resource endpoints for authenticated users and admin-specific paths.</li>
<li>LoginRequestDTO: Model the login request payload (username/password).</li>
<li>TokenDTO: Model the authentication response including token and expiration.</li>
</ul>
<p>These components complete the stateless authentication flow by handling login, token issuance, cookie management, and resource protection.</p>
<p>In this section, we expose REST controllers and DTOs to handle user authentication, token issuance, and protected resource access.</p>

<p>Use cookie to access hello endpoint:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">curl -b "accessToken=&#x3C;jwe-token>" http://localhost:8080/api/hello
</code></pre>
<p>Use Authorization header instead:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">curl -H "Authorization: Bearer &#x3C;jwe-token>" http://localhost:8080/api/hello

<p>Access admin-only endpoint:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">curl -H "Authorization: Bearer &#x3C;jwe-token>" http://localhost:8080/api/hello/admin

<h3>User Flow</h3>
<p>Login as user and capture JWE token from cookie:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spring Boot 3.2+ introduces the HTTP Interface Client, enabling you to define declarative, type-safe HTTP clients with simple Java or Kotlin interfaces. In this article, you’ll learn to set it up from scratch using the JSONPlaceholder API.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🌟 Why HTTP Interface Client?</h2>
<p>In this section, we clarify Why HTTP Interface Client? and summarize the key points you will apply in implementation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Declarative: Define an interface and annotate methods for HTTP calls.</li>
<li>Type-safe: Compiler catches mismatched signatures or misconfigured paths.</li>
<li>Minimal boilerplate: One bean definition, no manual proxy or template code.</li>
<li>Spring-friendly: Leverages Spring Framework 6.2’s <code>@HttpExchange</code>, <code>@GetExchange</code>, and <code>WebClientAdapter</code>.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>📋 Prerequisites</h2>
<p>In this section, we clarify Prerequisites and summarize the key points you will apply in implementation.</p>
<ul>
<li>☕ Java Development Kit (JDK) 21 or higher</li>
<li>📦 Spring Boot 3.2+</li>
<li>🔤 IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<h2>🛠️ Step 1: Add Dependencies</h2>
<p>Add the Web starter to your build:</p>
<p>Maven:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&#x3C;dependency>
  &#x3C;groupId>org.springframework.boot&#x3C;/groupId>
  &#x3C;artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web&#x3C;/artifactId>
&#x3C;/dependency>
</code></pre>
<p>Gradle:</p>
<pre><code class="language-groovy">implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web'
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Step 2: Configure Base URL</h2>
<p>Add to <code>application.yml</code> or <code>application.properties</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">jsonplaceholder:
  base-url: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-properties">jsonplaceholder.base-url=https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Step 3: Define DTO and Client Interface</h2>
<h3>Java</h3>
<pre><code class="language-java">// src/main/java/com/example/client/dto/PostDTO.java
package com.example.client.dto;

public record PostDTO(
    Integer userId,
    Integer id,

import org.springframework.web.service.annotation.HttpExchange;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PathVariable;
import java.util.List;

@HttpExchange(url = "${jsonplaceholder.base-url}", accept = "application/json")
public interface JsonPlaceholderClient {

    @GetExchange("/posts")
    List&#x3C;PostDTO> getPosts();

    @GetExchange("/posts/{id}")
    PostDTO getPost(@PathVariable("id") Integer id);
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Kotlin</h3>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">// src/main/kotlin/com/example/client/dto/PostDTO.kt
package com.example.client.dto

data class PostDTO(
    val userId: Int,
    val id: Int,
    val title: String,
    val body: String
)

import org.springframework.web.service.annotation.GetExchange
import org.springframework.web.service.annotation.HttpExchange
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PathVariable

@HttpExchange(url = "${jsonplaceholder.base-url}", accept = "application/json")
interface JsonPlaceholderClient {

    @GetExchange("/posts")
    fun getPosts(): List&#x3C;PostDTO>

    @GetExchange("/posts/{id}")
    fun getPost(@PathVariable("id") id: Int): PostDTO
}
</code></pre>

        var factory = HttpServiceProxyFactory
            .builderFor(RestClientAdapter.create(restClient))
            .build();

        return factory.createClient(JsonPlaceholderClient.class);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Kotlin</h3>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">// src/main/kotlin/com/example/config/HttpClientConfig.kt

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spring Boot 3.2+ lets you combine the simplicity of <code>@Async</code> with JDK 21 virtual threads for ultra-lightweight concurrency. Offload work to isolated virtual threads without complex pool configs.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🌟 Why Use Virtual Thread in Spring Boot?</h2>
<p>In this section, we clarify Why Use Virtual Thread in Spring Boot? and summarize the key points you will apply in implementation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ultra-Lightweight: Virtual threads are thousands of times cheaper than platform threads.</li>
<li>Non-Blocking: <code>@Async</code> methods run off the main thread, improving responsiveness.</li>
<li>Scalable: Handle high concurrency with minimal resource overhead.</li>
<li>Simple Config: Enable with a single property, no custom executors needed.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>📋 Prerequisites</h2>
<p>In this section, we clarify Prerequisites and summarize the key points you will apply in implementation.</p>
<ul>
<li>☕ Java Development Kit (JDK) 21 or higher</li>
<li>📦 Spring Boot 3.2+</li>
<li>🔤 IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Step 1: Add Dependencies</h2>
<p>To enable async processing, include spring-boot-starter-web in your <code>pom.xml</code> or <code>build.gradle</code> file.</p>
<p>Maven:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&#x3C;dependency>
    &#x3C;groupId>org.springframework.boot&#x3C;/groupId>
    &#x3C;artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web&#x3C;/artifactId>
&#x3C;/dependency>
</code></pre>
<p>Gradle:</p>
<pre><code class="language-groovy">implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web'
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Step 2: Enable Virtual Threads</h2>
<p>Add to <code>application.yml</code> or <code>application.properties</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">spring:
  threads:
    virtual:
      enabled: true
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-properties">spring.threads.virtual.enabled=true
</code></pre>
<p>This setting auto-configures the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>applicationTaskExecutor</code> for <code>@Async</code> support</li>
<li>Task scheduler for <code>@Scheduled</code> methods</li>
<li>Servlet container thread pools (Tomcat/Jetty) to use virtual threads</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Step 3: Enable Async Support</h2>
<p>Annotate your main application class in Java or Kotlin:</p>
<h3>Java</h3>
<pre><code class="language-java">package com.example.async;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.EnableAsync;

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableAsync
public class AsyncVirtualApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(AsyncVirtualApplication.class, args);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Kotlin</h3>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">package com.example.async

import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication
import org.springframework.boot.runApplication
import org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.EnableAsync

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableAsync
class AsyncVirtualApplication

fun main(args: Array&#x3C;String>) {
    runApplication&#x3C;AsyncVirtualApplication>(*args)
}
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Step 4: Define an Async Service</h2>
<p>Create a service with <code>@Async</code>. It will run each call on a new virtual thread.</p>
<h3>Java</h3>
<pre><code class="language-java">package com.example.async;

import lombok.extern.slf4j.Slf4j;
import org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.Async;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

import java.time.LocalTime;
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;

@Slf4j
@Service
public class AsyncVirtualService {

  @Async
  public void runTask() {
    log.info("[{}] Async start on {}", LocalTime.now(), Thread.currentThread());
    try {
      Thread.sleep(1000);
    } catch (InterruptedException ignored) {}
    log.info("[{}] Async end on {}", LocalTime.now(), Thread.currentThread());
  }

  @Async
  public CompletableFuture&#x3C;String> runAndReturn() throws InterruptedException {
    Thread.sleep(500);
    return CompletableFuture.completedFuture("Completed");
  }
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Kotlin</h3>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">package com.example.async

import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory
import org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.Async
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service

import java.time.LocalTime
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture

@Service
class AsyncVirtualService {
  private val log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(AsyncVirtualService::class.java)

  @Async
  fun runTask() {
    log.info("[{}] Async start on {}", LocalTime.now(), Thread.currentThread())
    try {
      Thread.sleep(1000)
    } catch (_: InterruptedException) {}
    log.info("[{}] Async end on {}", LocalTime.now(), Thread.currentThread())
  }

  @Async
  fun runAndReturn(): CompletableFuture&#x3C;String> {
    Thread.sleep(500)
    return CompletableFuture.completedFuture("Completed")
  }
}
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Step 5: Trigger via REST Controller</h2>
<p>Expose endpoints to invoke your async methods:</p>
<h3>Java</h3>
<pre><code class="language-java">package com.example.async;

import lombok.RequiredArgsConstructor;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/async")
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class AsyncVirtualController {

  private final AsyncVirtualService service;

  @GetMapping("/run")
  public String triggerRun() {
    service.runTask();
    return "Async virtual thread task triggered";
  }

  @GetMapping("/run-return")
  public String triggerRunAndReturn() throws Exception {
    var future = service.runAndReturn();
    return future.get();
  }
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Kotlin</h3>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">package com.example.async

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController

import lombok.RequiredArgsConstructor

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/async")
@RequiredArgsConstructor
class AsyncVirtualController(private val service: AsyncVirtualService) {

  @GetMapping("/run")
  fun triggerRun(): String {
    service.runTask()
    return "Async virtual thread task triggered"
  }

  @GetMapping("/run-return")
  @Throws(Exception::class)
  fun triggerRunAndReturn(): String {
    val future = service.runAndReturn()
    return future.get()
  }
}
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>▶️ Run the App</h2>
<pre><code class="language-bash">./mvnw spring-boot:run
# or
gradle bootRun
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>🧪 Test Endpoints</h2>
<p>Trigger void task</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">curl http://localhost:8080/async/run
</code></pre>
<p>Check logs for virtual thread start/end.</p>
<p>Trigger task with return</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">curl http://localhost:8080/async/run-return
# returns "Completed"
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>🏁 Conclusion</h2>
<p>You now have a practical Spring Boot Async Tasks with Virtual Thread implementation with a clear, production-friendly Spring Boot structure. As a next step, adapt configuration and tests to your own domain, then validate behavior under realistic traffic and failure scenarios.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spring AI is a framework for AI engineering that applies Spring’s portability and modular design principles to AI workloads. It lets you build AI-driven applications using familiar Spring idioms and POJOs.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🌟 Why Use Spring AI?</h2>
<p>In this section, we clarify Why Use Spring AI? and summarize the key points you will apply in implementation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Provider-agnostic portability: Write code once and switch between AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, etc.) without changes.</li>
<li>POJO-based design: Model AI inputs and outputs as plain Java/Kotlin objects for type safety and easy integration.</li>
<li>Structured outputs: Automatically map model responses to your domain objects.</li>
<li>Vector store integration: Seamless support for major vector databases (Chroma, Pinecone, Redis, etc.) via a unified API.</li>
<li>Tool/function calling: Enable LLMs to invoke custom functions or services for real-time data.</li>
<li>Observability &#x26; evaluation: Built-in metrics and evaluation utilities to monitor AI operations and detect hallucinations.</li>
<li>Chat abstractions: Fluent ChatClient API, similar to Spring’s WebClient, for building conversational agents.</li>
<li>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG): Simplify document-based QA and memory-backed chat with advisors and memory APIs.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>📋 Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Ensure you have the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>☕ Java Development Kit (JDK) 17+</li>
<li>📦 Maven or Gradle installed</li>
<li>🐳 Spring Boot 3+</li>
<li>🔑 OpenAI API Key (set as environment variable <code>OPENAI_API_KEY</code>)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Step 1: Add Dependencies</h2>
<p>Include Spring AI starter for OpenAI, Spring Web, and Lombok.</p>
<h3>Maven</h3>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&#x3C;dependencies>
  &#x3C;dependency>

  compileOnly 'org.projectlombok:lombok'
  annotationProcessor 'org.projectlombok:lombok'
}
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Step 2: Configuration</h2>
<p>In <code>application.yml</code>, configure your OpenAI key and set the ChatClient model:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">spring:
  ai:
    openai:
      api-key: ${OPENAI_API_KEY}
      chat:
        options:
          model: gpt-4.1-mini
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Step 3: Implement the Service Layer</h2>
<p>Create an <code>AIService</code> to wrap your ChatClient. Inject <code>ChatClient.Builder</code> and build the client.</p>
<h3>Java</h3>
<pre><code class="language-java">package com.example.ai.service;

import org.springframework.ai.chat.client.ChatClient;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;
import lombok.RequiredArgsConstructor;

@Service
public class AIService {

    public AIService(ChatClient.Builder builder) {
        this.chatClient = builder.build();
    }

    public String getJoke(String topic) {
        return chatClient.prompt()
                .user(u -> u.text("Tell me a joke about {topic}").param("topic", topic))
                .call()
                .content();
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Kotlin</h3>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">package com.example.ai.service

import org.springframework.stereotype.Service

@Service
class AIService(builder: ChatClient.Builder) {
    private val chatClient: ChatClient = builder.build()

    fun getJoke(topic: String): String {
        return chatClient.prompt()
            .user { it.text("Tell me a joke about {topic}").param("topic", topic) }
            .call()
            .content()
    }
}
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Step 4: Expose a REST Controller</h2>
<p>Create a <code>ChatController</code> to expose your AIService over HTTP.</p>
<h3>Java</h3>
<pre><code class="language-java">package com.example.ai.controller;

import com.example.ai.service.AIService;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestParam;

    private final AIService aiService;

    @GetMapping("/joke")
    public String getJoke(@RequestParam(defaultValue = "dogs") String topic) {
        return aiService.getJoke(topic);
    }

    @GetMapping("/joke")
    fun getJoke(@RequestParam(defaultValue = "dogs") topic: String): String {
        return aiService.getJoke(topic)
    }
}
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>▶️ Running the Application</h2>
<p>Start your Spring Boot app:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">./mvnw spring-boot:run
# or
gradle bootRun
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>🧪 Testing the Integration</h2>
<p>Call your service via HTTP:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/joke?topic=dogs"
# Returns a dog joke generated by the AI model.
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>🏁 Conclusion</h2>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JPA Auditing in Spring Boot allows you to automatically track who created or modified an entity and when. This is extremely useful for audit logs, history tracking, and debugging.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🌟 Why Use JPA Auditing?</h2>
<p>In this section, we clarify Why Use JPA Auditing? and summarize the key points you will apply in implementation.</p>
<ul>
<li>📅 Auto track <code>createdDate</code>, <code>lastModifiedDate</code></li>
<li>👤 Record <code>createdBy</code>, <code>modifiedBy</code></li>
<li>🧼 Cleaner code by avoiding manual field setting</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>📋 Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Before you start, prepare the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Java 17+</li>
<li>Spring Boot 3.x project with Spring Data JPA</li>
<li>A configured datasource (H2, PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)</li>
<li>Basic familiarity with JPA entities and repository flow</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Step 1: Add Dependencies</h2>
<p>Make sure you have the following dependencies in your project:</p>
<p>Maven:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&#x3C;dependency>
  &#x3C;groupId>org.springframework.boot&#x3C;/groupId>
  &#x3C;artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-jpa&#x3C;/artifactId>
&#x3C;/dependency>
</code></pre>
<p>Gradle:</p>
<pre><code class="language-groovy">dependencies {
  implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-data-jpa'
}
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Step 2: Enable JPA Auditing</h2>
<p>Add <code>@EnableJpaAuditing</code> to your main class or a configuration class.</p>
<h3>Java</h3>
<pre><code class="language-java">import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.config.EnableJpaAuditing;

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableJpaAuditing(auditorAwareRef = "auditorProvider")
public class DemoApplication {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
  }
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Kotlin</h3>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication
import org.springframework.boot.runApplication
import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.config.EnableJpaAuditing

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableJpaAuditing(auditorAwareRef = "auditorProvider")
class DemoApplication

fun main(args: Array&#x3C;String>) {
    runApplication&#x3C;DemoApplication>(*args)
}
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Step 3: Create AuditorAware Bean</h2>
<p>This bean tells Spring Security who the current user is. Here's a basic static user example:</p>
<h3>Java</h3>
<pre><code class="language-java">@Configuration
public class AuditingConfig {

  @Bean
  public AuditorAware&#x3C;String> auditorProvider() {
    return () -> Optional.of("Şuayb");
  }
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Kotlin</h3>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">@Configuration
class AuditingConfig {

  @Bean
  fun auditorProvider(): AuditorAware&#x3C;String> = AuditorAware { Optional.of("Şuayb") }
}
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Step 4: Annotate Your Entity</h2>
<p>Use auditing annotations like <code>@CreatedDate</code>, <code>@LastModifiedDate</code>, etc.</p>
<h3>Java</h3>
<pre><code class="language-java">@Entity
@EntityListeners(AuditingEntityListener.class)
public class Article {

  @Id
  @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
  private Long id;

  private String title;

  @CreatedDate
  private LocalDateTime createdDate;

  @LastModifiedDate
  private LocalDateTime lastModifiedDate;

  @CreatedBy
  private String createdBy;

  @LastModifiedBy
  private String lastModifiedBy;

  // getters &#x26; setters
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Kotlin</h3>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">@Entity
@EntityListeners(AuditingEntityListener::class)
data class Article(
  @Id
  @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
  val id: Long? = null,

  var title: String? = null,

  @CreatedDate
  var createdDate: LocalDateTime? = null,

  @LastModifiedDate
  var lastModifiedDate: LocalDateTime? = null,

  @CreatedBy
  var createdBy: String? = null,

  @LastModifiedBy
  var lastModifiedBy: String? = null
)
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>▶️ Running the Application</h2>
<p>Now when you save an entity using <code>JpaRepository</code>, auditing fields will be populated automatically.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🧪 Testing</h2>
<p>You can test JPA Auditing functionality by saving an entity and checking whether the audit fields are populated.</p>
<h3>Java</h3>
<pre><code class="language-java">@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureTestDatabase
@Transactional
class ArticleRepositoryTest {

  @Autowired
  private ArticleRepository articleRepository;

  @Test
  void testAuditFieldsAreSet() {
    Article article = new Article();
    article.setTitle("Test Title");

    Article saved = articleRepository.save(article);

    assertNotNull(saved.getCreatedDate());
    assertNotNull(saved.getLastModifiedDate());
    assertEquals("Şuayb", saved.getCreatedBy());
    assertEquals("Şuayb", saved.getLastModifiedBy());
  }
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Kotlin</h3>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureTestDatabase
@Transactional
class ArticleRepositoryTest {

  @Autowired
  lateinit var articleRepository: ArticleRepository

  @Test
  fun `should set audit fields`() {
    val article = Article().apply {
      title = "Test Title"
    }

    val saved = articleRepository.save(article)

    assertNotNull(saved.createdDate)
    assertNotNull(saved.lastModifiedDate)
    assertEquals("Şuayb", saved.createdBy)
    assertEquals("Şuayb", saved.lastModifiedBy)
  }
}
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>🏁 Conclusion</h2>
<p>You now have a practical Spring Boot JPA Auditing implementation with a clear, production-friendly Spring Boot structure. As a next step, adapt configuration and tests to your own domain, then validate behavior under realistic traffic and failure scenarios.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Test-Driven Development (TDD) helps you build robust applications by writing tests before implementing business logic. With Spring Boot, writing unit tests is fast, clean, and efficient.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🌟 Why Use TDD in Spring Boot?</h2>
<p>In this section, we clarify Why Use TDD in Spring Boot? and summarize the key points you will apply in implementation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fail Fast: Catch issues early during development.</li>
<li>Clean Design: Forces modular, testable code structure.</li>
<li>Refactor with Confidence: Tests serve as a safety net.</li>
<li>Documentation: Tests describe intended behavior clearly.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>📋 Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Make sure you have:</p>
<ul>
<li>☕ JDK 17+ installed</li>
<li>📦 Maven or Gradle</li>
<li>🔤 A Java IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>🧪 Step 1: Add Test Dependencies</h2>
<p>Add Spring Boot's test starter to your project.</p>
<p>Maven:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&#x3C;dependency>
  &#x3C;groupId>org.springframework.boot&#x3C;/groupId>
  &#x3C;artifactId>spring-boot-starter-test&#x3C;/artifactId>
  &#x3C;scope>test&#x3C;/scope>
&#x3C;/dependency>
</code></pre>
<p>Gradle:</p>
<pre><code class="language-groovy">testImplementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-test'
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>🧪 Step 2: Write Your First Test</h2>
<p>Create a simple unit test before implementing the service.</p>
<h3>Java</h3>
<pre><code class="language-java">package com.example.tdd;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

class GreetingServiceTest {

    @Test
    void shouldReturnGreetingMessage() {
        GreetingService service = new GreetingService();
        String result = service.greet("World");
        assertEquals("Hello, World!", result);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Kotlin</h3>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">package com.example.tdd

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test

class GreetingServiceTest {

    @Test
    fun shouldReturnGreetingMessage() {
        val service = GreetingService()
        val result = service.greet("World")
        assertEquals("Hello, World!", result)
    }
}
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Step 3: Implement the Service</h2>
<p>Now implement the <code>GreetingService</code> to pass the test.</p>
<h3>Java</h3>
<pre><code class="language-java">package com.example.tdd;

public class GreetingService {
    public String greet(String name) {
        return "Hello, " + name + "!";
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Kotlin</h3>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">package com.example.tdd

class GreetingService {
    fun greet(name: String): String {
        return "Hello, $name!"
    }
}
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>▶️ Running the Tests</h2>
<p>Use your build tool to run the tests:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">./mvnw test
</code></pre>
<p>Or with Gradle:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">gradle test
</code></pre>
<p>You should see the test pass ✅</p>
<hr>
<h3>Refactor and Repeat</h3>
<p>Now that your test passes, you can safely refactor your code. TDD is a loop:</p>
<ol>
<li>Red – Write a failing test</li>
<li>Green – Make it pass</li>
<li>Refactor – Improve the code</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2>🏁 Conclusion</h2>
<p>You now have a practical Spring Boot Test-Driven Development implementation with a clear, production-friendly Spring Boot structure. As a next step, adapt configuration and tests to your own domain, then validate behavior under realistic traffic and failure scenarios.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Step 4: Register a Client Application</h2>
<p>In this section, we clarify Step 4: Register a Client Application and summarize the key points you will apply in implementation.</p>
<h3>Add Dependencies</h3>
<p>Add the Eureka Client starter first so this application can register with the server and participate in service discovery.</p>
<p>Maven:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&#x3C;dependency>
    &#x3C;groupId>org.springframework.cloud&#x3C;/groupId>
    &#x3C;artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client&#x3C;/artifactId>

</code></pre>
<p>Gradle:</p>
<pre><code class="language-groovy">implementation 'org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client'
</code></pre>
<h3>Client Application Configuration</h3>
<p>In the client's <code>application.yml</code>, add the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">spring:
  application:
    name: eureka-client
eureka:
  client:
    service-url:
      defaultZone: http://localhost:8761/eureka/
</code></pre>
<h3>Client Application Code</h3>
<p>The sample below provides a minimal client implementation so you can validate the server integration end to end.</p>
<h3>Java</h3>
<pre><code class="language-java">package com.example.eurekaclient;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;

    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(EurekaClientApplication.class, args);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Kotlin</h3>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">package com.example.eurekaclient

import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spring Boot Config Server enables centralized configuration management for distributed applications, allowing dynamic configuration updates without requiring service restarts. This guide covers how to set up and use Spring Boot Config Server efficiently.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🌟 Why Use Config Server?</h2>
<p>In this section, we clarify Why Use Config Server? and summarize the key points you will apply in implementation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Centralized Configuration: Manage application settings in a single place.</li>
<li>Dynamic Updates: Update configurations without restarting services.</li>
<li>Environment Profiles: Support different configurations for dev, test, and production environments.</li>
<li>Security &#x26; Access Control: Store sensitive configurations securely.</li>
<li>Integration with Git: Keep configuration versions managed and trackable.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>📋 Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Ensure you have the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>☕ Java Development Kit (JDK) 17+</li>
<li>📦 Maven or Gradle installed</li>
<li>📁 Git Repository (for storing configurations)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Step 1: Add Dependencies</h2>
<p>Add the necessary dependencies for Spring Cloud Config Server.</p>
<p>Maven:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&#x3C;dependency>
    &#x3C;groupId>org.springframework.cloud&#x3C;/groupId>
    &#x3C;artifactId>spring-cloud-config-server&#x3C;/artifactId>
&#x3C;/dependency>
</code></pre>
<p>Gradle:</p>
<pre><code class="language-groovy">implementation 'org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-config-server'
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Step 2: Create the Config Server Application</h2>
<h3>Java</h3>
<pre><code class="language-java">package com.example.configserver;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.cloud.config.server.EnableConfigServer;

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableConfigServer
public class ConfigServerApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(ConfigServerApplication.class, args);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Kotlin</h3>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">package com.example.configserver

import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication
import org.springframework.boot.runApplication
import org.springframework.cloud.config.server.EnableConfigServer

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableConfigServer
class ConfigServerApplication

fun main(args: Array&#x3C;String>) {
    runApplication&#x3C;ConfigServerApplication>(*args)
}
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Step 3: Configure the Config Server</h2>
<p>Create an <code>application.yml</code> file to specify the Git repository for storing configurations.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">server:
  port: 8888
spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/example/config-repo
          default-label: main
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Replace <code>https://github.com/example/config-repo</code> with your actual Git repository.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Step 4: Create a Configuration Repository</h2>
<p>In your Git repository (e.g., <code>config-repo</code>), create an <code>application.yml</code> file with the following content:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">config.key: 'Hello from Config Server!'
</code></pre>
<p>Commit and push the file to the repository:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git add application.yml
git commit -m "Add config properties"
git push origin main
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>▶️ Running the Config Server</h2>
<p>Start the Config Server application:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code></pre>
<p>or using Gradle:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">gradle bootRun
</code></pre>
<p>Verify it is running by accessing:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">curl -X GET http://localhost:8888/application/default
</code></pre>
<p>Expected Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
  "name": "application",
  "profiles": ["default"],
  "propertySources": [
    {
      "name": "https://github.com/example/config-repo/application.yml",
      "source": {
        "config.key": "Hello from Config Server!"
      }
    }
  ]
}
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Step 5: Configure a Client Application</h2>
<p>In this section, we clarify Step 5: Configure a Client Application and summarize the key points you will apply in implementation.</p>
<h3>Add Dependencies</h3>
<p>First, include the Config Client starter so this service can pull centralized configuration during bootstrap.</p>
<p>Maven:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&#x3C;dependency>
    &#x3C;groupId>org.springframework.cloud&#x3C;/groupId>
    &#x3C;artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-config&#x3C;/artifactId>
&#x3C;/dependency>
</code></pre>
<p>Gradle:</p>
<pre><code class="language-groovy">implementation 'org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-config'
</code></pre>
<h3>Client Application Configuration</h3>
<p>In the client's <code>bootstrap.yml</code>, add the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">spring:
  application:
    name: config-client
  cloud:
    config:
      uri: http://localhost:8888
</code></pre>
<h3>Client Application Code</h3>
<p>The sample below provides a minimal client implementation so you can validate the server integration end to end.</p>
<h3>Java</h3>
<pre><code class="language-java">package com.example.configclient;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;

@SpringBootApplication
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/config")
public class ConfigClientApplication {

  @Value("${config.key:not found}")
  private String configValue;

  @GetMapping
  public String getConfigValue() {
    return "Config Value: " + configValue;
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(ConfigClientApplication.class, args);
  }
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Kotlin</h3>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">package com.example.configclient

import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication
import org.springframework.boot.runApplication
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value

@SpringBootApplication
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/config")
class ConfigClientApplication {

    @Value("\${config.key:not found}")
    lateinit var configValue: String

    @GetMapping
    fun getConfigValue(): String {
        return "Config Value: \$configValue"
    }
}

fun main(args: Array&#x3C;String>) {
    runApplication&#x3C;ConfigClientApplication>(*args)
}
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>▶️ Running the Client Application</h2>
<p>Run the Config Client application:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code></pre>
<p>or using Gradle:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">gradle bootRun
</code></pre>
<p>Retrieve the configuration from Config Server:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/config
</code></pre>
<p>Expected Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">Config Value: Hello from Config Server!
</code></pre>

<h2>🛠️ Step 4: Implement Kafka Producer and Consumer</h2>
<p>In this section, we clarify Step 4: Implement Kafka Producer and Consumer and summarize the key points you will apply in implementation.</p>
<h3>Producer Example</h3>
<p>This producer example shows how to publish messages consistently to the target topic.</p>
<h3>Java</h3>
<pre><code class="language-java">package com.example.kafka.producer;

import com.example.kafka.model.Message;
import lombok.RequiredArgsConstructor;
import org.springframework.kafka.core.KafkaTemplate;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class KafkaProducer {

    private final KafkaTemplate&#x3C;String, Message> kafkaTemplate;

    public void sendMessage(String topic, Message message) {
        kafkaTemplate.send(topic, message);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Kotlin</h3>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">package com.example.kafka.producer

import com.example.kafka.model.Message
import org.springframework.kafka.core.KafkaTemplate
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service

@Service
class KafkaProducer(private val kafkaTemplate: KafkaTemplate&#x3C;String, Message>) {

    fun sendMessage(topic: String, message: Message) {
        kafkaTemplate.send(topic, message)
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Consumer Example</h3>
<p>This consumer example demonstrates how incoming messages are read and processed.</p>
<h3>Java</h3>
<pre><code class="language-java">package com.example.kafka.consumer;

import com.example.kafka.model.Message;
import org.springframework.kafka.annotation.KafkaListener;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class KafkaConsumer {

    @KafkaListener(topics = "my-topic", groupId = "my-group")
    public void consumeMessage(Message message) {
        System.out.println("Received message: " + message);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Kotlin</h3>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">package com.example.kafka.consumer

import com.example.kafka.model.Message
import org.springframework.kafka.annotation.KafkaListener
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service

@Service
class KafkaConsumer {

    @KafkaListener(topics = ["my-topic"], groupId = "my-group")
    fun consumeMessage(message: Message) {
        println("Received message: $message")
    }
}
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h3>Controller Example</h3>
<p>This controller exposes a simple endpoint so you can trigger and verify messaging behavior.</p>
<h3>Java</h3>
<pre><code class="language-java">package com.example.kafka.controller;

import com.example.kafka.model.Message;
import com.example.kafka.producer.KafkaProducer;
import lombok.RequiredArgsConstructor;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/kafka")
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class KafkaController {

    private final KafkaProducer kafkaProducer;

    @PostMapping("/publish")
    public String publishMessage(@RequestParam String topic, @RequestBody Message message) {
        kafkaProducer.sendMessage(topic, message);
        return "Message sent to topic: " + topic;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Kotlin</h3>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">package com.example.kafka.controller

import com.example.kafka.model.Message
import com.example.kafka.producer.KafkaProducer
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/kafka")
class KafkaController(private val kafkaProducer: KafkaProducer) {

    @PostMapping("/publish")
    fun publishMessage(@RequestParam topic: String, @RequestBody message: Message): String {
        kafkaProducer.sendMessage(topic, message)
        return "Message sent to topic: $topic"
    }
}
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>▶️ Running the Application</h2>
<p>Run the application using the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>🧪 Testing the API</h2>
<p>You can test the Kafka Producer endpoint using cURL or Postman:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/kafka/publish" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"id": "123", "content": "Hello Kafka!"}'
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>🏁 Conclusion</h2>
<p>You now have a practical Spring Boot Kafka Integration implementation with a clear, production-friendly Spring Boot structure. As a next step, adapt configuration and tests to your own domain, then validate behavior under realistic traffic and failure scenarios.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://suaybsimsek.com/en/posts/spring-boot-redis-caching</guid>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Redis is a powerful in-memory data store often used for caching, messaging, and real-time data management. This guide explains how to integrate Redis into a Spring Boot application using both Java and Kotlin.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🌟 Why Use Redis?</h2>
<p>In this section, we clarify Why Use Redis? and summarize the key points you will apply in implementation.</p>
<ul>
<li>High Performance: Redis provides extremely low latency for read and write operations.</li>
<li>Versatile Data Structures: Supports strings, hashes, lists, sets, and more.</li>
<li>Scalability: Ideal for distributed caching and real-time analytics.</li>
<li>Integration: Easily integrates with Spring Boot for seamless development.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>📋 Prerequisites</h2>
<p>🗈 Ensure you have the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>☕ Java Development Kit (JDK) 17+</li>
<li>📦 Maven or Gradle installed</li>
<li>🔤 A Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)</li>
<li>💠 Redis Server installed and running locally or accessible via a network</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Step 1: Add Dependencies</h2>
<p>To integrate Redis into your Spring Boot project, add the following dependencies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maven:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&#x3C;dependency>
  &#x3C;groupId>org.springframework.boot&#x3C;/groupId>
  &#x3C;artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-redis&#x3C;/artifactId>
&#x3C;/dependency>
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Gradle:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-groovy">implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-data-redis'
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Step 2: Configure Redis</h2>
<p>Set up the Redis connection in your <code>application.properties</code> or <code>application.yml</code> file.</p>
<h3>Example Configuration:</h3>
<p>Use this configuration as a baseline and adjust values for your local or production environment.</p>
<pre><code class="language-properties">spring.redis.host=localhost
spring.redis.port=6379
</code></pre>
<p>For advanced setups, such as password authentication or SSL, add these properties:</p>
<pre><code class="language-properties">spring.redis.password=yourpassword
spring.redis.ssl=true
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Step 3: Enable Caching</h2>
<p>Add the <code>@EnableCaching</code> annotation to your main application class to enable Spring's caching abstraction.</p>
<h3>Java</h3>
<pre><code class="language-java">package com.example.redis;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.cache.annotation.EnableCaching;

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableCaching
public class RedisApplication {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(RedisApplication.class, args);
  }
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Kotlin</h3>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">package com.example.redis

import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication
import org.springframework.boot.runApplication
import org.springframework.cache.annotation.EnableCaching

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableCaching
class RedisApplication

fun main(args: Array&#x3C;String>) {
  runApplication&#x3C;RedisApplication>(*args)
}
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Step 4: Service Layer Example with Caching</h2>
<h3>Java</h3>
<pre><code class="language-java">package com.example.redis.service;

import org.springframework.cache.annotation.Cacheable;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class UserService {

  @Cacheable("users")
  public String getUserById(String id) {
    simulateSlowService();
    return "User with ID: " + id;
  }

  private void simulateSlowService() {
    try {
      Thread.sleep(3000L);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
      throw new IllegalStateException(e);
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Kotlin</h3>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">package com.example.redis.service

import org.springframework.cache.annotation.Cacheable
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service

@Service
class UserService {

  @Cacheable("users")
  fun getUserById(id: String): String {
    simulateSlowService()
    return "User with ID: $id"
  }

  private fun simulateSlowService() {
    Thread.sleep(3000L)
  }
}
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h3>Configuring TTL (Time-To-Live)</h3>
<p>Set the cache expiration time in your <code>application.properties</code> file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-properties">spring.cache.redis.time-to-live=600000
</code></pre>
<p>This sets the TTL to 10 minutes (600,000 milliseconds).</p>
<hr>
<h3>Controller Example</h3>
<p>Create a REST controller to expose the caching functionality.</p>
<h3>Java</h3>
<pre><code class="language-java">package com.example.redis.controller;

import com.example.redis.service.UserService;
import lombok.RequiredArgsConstructor;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/users")
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class UserController {

  private final UserService userService;

  @GetMapping("/{id}")
  public String getUser(@PathVariable String id) {
    return userService.getUserById(id);
  }
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Kotlin</h3>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">package com.example.redis.controller

import com.example.redis.service.UserService
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/users")
class UserController(
  private val userService: UserService
) {
  @GetMapping("/{id}")
  fun getUser(@PathVariable id: String): String = userService.getUserById(id)
}
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>▶️ Running the Application</h2>
<p>Run the application using the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>🧪 Testing the API</h2>
<p>You can test the API using cURL or Postman:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fetch a User (cached):</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-bash">curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/users/1
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>🏁 Conclusion</h2>
<p>You now have a practical Spring Boot Redis Caching implementation with a clear, production-friendly Spring Boot structure. As a next step, adapt configuration and tests to your own domain, then validate behavior under realistic traffic and failure scenarios.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://suaybsimsek.com/en/posts/spring-boot-clean-coding</guid>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Clean coding practices ensure that your Spring Boot applications are maintainable, readable, and scalable. This guide provides essential tips and code examples to help you write cleaner and more efficient code in both Java and Kotlin.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🌟 Why Focus on Clean Coding?</h2>
<p>Adopting clean coding principles helps to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve code readability and maintainability.</li>
<li>Reduce technical debt.</li>
<li>Make onboarding new developers easier.</li>
<li>Enhance scalability and debugging processes.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>📋 Prerequisites</h2>
<p>📋 Ensure you have the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>☕ Java Development Kit (JDK) 17+</li>
<li>📦 Maven or Gradle installed</li>
<li>🔤 A Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)</li>
<li>🛠️ Familiarity with Spring Boot basics</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Step 1: Structure Your Project</h2>
<p>Organize your Spring Boot project for better clarity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Controller Layer: Handles incoming HTTP requests.</li>
<li>Service Layer: Contains business logic.</li>
<li>Repository Layer: Interacts with the database.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Example Folder Structure:</h3>
<p>This structure keeps layers separated and makes future refactoring safer as the project grows.</p>
<pre><code class="language-filename=&#x22;snippet.txt&#x22;">src/main/java/com/example/cleanproject
├── controller
├── service
├── repository
├── entity
└── dto
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Step 2: Use Lombok for Cleaner Java Code</h2>
<p>Lombok reduces boilerplate code in Java, making your classes more concise and readable. Here's how to use Lombok effectively:</p>
<h3>Add Lombok Dependency</h3>
<p>Start by adding Lombok to your build so annotations are resolved correctly before refactoring your entities and DTOs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Maven:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&#x3C;dependency>
  &#x3C;groupId>org.projectlombok&#x3C;/groupId>
  &#x3C;artifactId>lombok&#x3C;/artifactId>
  &#x3C;scope>provided&#x3C;/scope>
&#x3C;/dependency>
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Gradle:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-groovy">provided 'org.projectlombok:lombok'
annotationProcessor 'org.projectlombok:lombok'
</code></pre>
<h3>Example: Entity with Lombok</h3>
<p>The following example gives practical context for Example: Entity with Lombok and can be applied directly.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">package com.example.cleanproject.entity;

import jakarta.persistence.*;
import lombok.Data;
import lombok.NoArgsConstructor;
import lombok.AllArgsConstructor;

@Data
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
@Entity
public class User {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String name;

    private String email;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>@Data</code> generates getters, setters, equals, hashCode, and toString methods.</li>
<li><code>@NoArgsConstructor</code> and <code>@AllArgsConstructor</code> create constructors.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Step 3: Write Concise and Readable Code in Kotlin</h2>
<p>Kotlin offers modern features that naturally lead to cleaner code:</p>
<h3>Example: Entity in Kotlin</h3>
<p>The following example gives practical context for Example: Entity in Kotlin and can be applied directly.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">package com.example.cleanproject.entity

import jakarta.persistence.*

@Entity
data class User(
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    val id: Long = 0,
    var name: String,
    var email: String
)
</code></pre>
<p>Advantages of Kotlin:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>data class</code> automatically generates <code>toString</code>, <code>equals</code>, and <code>hashCode</code> methods.</li>
<li>Immutable properties (<code>val</code>) ensure better stability.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Step 4: Follow Dependency Injection Principles</h2>
<p>Use dependency injection to decouple components and improve testability.</p>
<h3>Example: Service Layer with DI</h3>
<p>The following example gives practical context for Example: Service Layer with DI and can be applied directly.</p>
<h3>Java</h3>
<pre><code class="language-java">package com.example.cleanproject.service;

import com.example.cleanproject.entity.User;
import com.example.cleanproject.repository.UserRepository;
import lombok.RequiredArgsConstructor;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

import java.util.List;

@Service
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class UserService {

    private final UserRepository userRepository;

    public List&#x3C;User> getAllUsers() {
        return userRepository.findAll();
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Kotlin</h3>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">package com.example.cleanproject.service

import com.example.cleanproject.entity.User
import com.example.cleanproject.repository.UserRepository
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service

@Service
class UserService(
    private val userRepository: UserRepository
) {
    fun getAllUsers(): List&#x3C;User> = userRepository.findAll()
}
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Step 5: Use DTOs for Data Transfer</h2>
<p>Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) separate your domain and API layers, promoting better encapsulation.</p>
<h3>Example: DTO for User</h3>
<p>The following example gives practical context for Example: DTO for User and can be applied directly.</p>
<h3>Java</h3>
<pre><code class="language-java">package com.example.cleanproject.dto;

import lombok.Data;

@Data
public class UserDTO {
    private String name;
    private String email;
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Kotlin</h3>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">package com.example.cleanproject.dto

data class UserDTO(
    val name: String,
    val email: String
)
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h3>Controller Layer</h3>
<p>Implement a controller to handle HTTP requests and interact with the service layer.</p>
<h3>Java</h3>
<pre><code class="language-java">package com.example.cleanproject.controller;

import com.example.cleanproject.dto.UserDTO;
import com.example.cleanproject.service.UserService;
import lombok.RequiredArgsConstructor;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

import java.util.List;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/users")
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class UserController {

    private final UserService userService;

    @GetMapping
    public List&#x3C;UserDTO> getAllUsers() {
        return userService.getAllUsers();
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Kotlin</h3>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">package com.example.cleanproject.controller

import com.example.cleanproject.dto.UserDTO
import com.example.cleanproject.service.UserService
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://suaybsimsek.com/en/posts/spring-boot-actuator</guid>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spring Boot Actuator provides production-ready features to monitor and manage your applications. This guide explores Actuator's capabilities, how to enable it, and secure its endpoints.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🌟 Why Use Spring Boot Actuator?</h2>
<p>Spring Boot Actuator allows developers to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monitor application health</li>
<li>Gather metrics and information</li>
<li>Expose management endpoints for operational tasks</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>📋 Prerequisites</h2>
<p>📋 Ensure you have the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>☕ Java Development Kit (JDK) 17+</li>
<li>💼 Maven or Gradle installed</li>
<li>🄄 A Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Step 1: Add Dependencies</h2>
<p>To enable Actuator, add the following dependency to your Spring Boot project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maven:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&#x3C;dependency>
  &#x3C;groupId>org.springframework.boot&#x3C;/groupId>
  &#x3C;artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator&#x3C;/artifactId>
&#x3C;/dependency>
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Gradle:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-groovy">implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-actuator'
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Step 2: Enable Actuator Endpoints</h2>
<p>By default, Actuator exposes several endpoints to provide application insights. You can enable these endpoints in your <code>application.properties</code> or <code>application.yml</code> file.</p>
<h3>Configuration Example:</h3>
<p>Use this configuration as a baseline and adjust values for your local or production environment.</p>
<pre><code class="language-properties">management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=health,info,metrics
management.endpoint.health.show-details=always
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Step 3: Using Actuator Endpoints</h2>
<p>Here are some commonly used Actuator endpoints:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>/actuator/health</code>: Provides application health status.</li>
<li><code>/actuator/info</code>: Displays application metadata.</li>
<li><code>/actuator/metrics</code>: Offers application performance metrics.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can access these endpoints via a browser or API tools like cURL.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Step 4: Customize Actuator Endpoints</h2>
<p>You can customize Actuator endpoints to suit your needs. For example, you can define additional metadata in the <code>application.properties</code> file for the <code>/actuator/info</code> endpoint:</p>
<pre><code class="language-properties">info.app.name=My Application
info.app.version=1.0.0
info.app.description=Spring Boot Actuator Example
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Step 5: Secure Actuator Endpoints</h2>
<p>For production environments, it's essential to secure Actuator endpoints. Use Spring Security to restrict access.</p>
<h3>Java</h3>
<p>Example Security Configuration</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">package com.example.demo.config;

import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.web.SecurityFilterChain;

@Configuration
public class SecurityConfig {

    public SecurityFilterChain securityFilterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .authorizeHttpRequests()
                .requestMatchers("/actuator/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
                .anyRequest().authenticated()
            .and()
            .httpBasic();
        return http.build();
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Kotlin</h3>
<p>Example Security Configuration</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">package com.example.demo.config

import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity
import org.springframework.security.web.SecurityFilterChain

@Configuration
class SecurityConfig {

    @Bean
    fun securityFilterChain(http: HttpSecurity): SecurityFilterChain {
        http
            .authorizeHttpRequests()
                .requestMatchers("/actuator/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
                .anyRequest().authenticated()
            .and()
            .httpBasic()
        return http.build()
    }
}
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>▶️ Running the Application</h2>
<p>Run the application using the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code></pre>
<p>Access the Actuator endpoints at:</p>
<pre><code class="language-filename=&#x22;snippet.txt&#x22;">http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>🧪 Test the API</h2>
<p>You can test the Actuator endpoints using cURL or browser:</p>
<ul>
<li>Health Endpoint:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-bash">curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Info Endpoint:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-bash">curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/actuator/info
</code></pre>
<hr>

</code></pre>
<p>Gradle:</p>
<pre><code class="language-groovy">implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-aop'
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Step 2: Define a Service</h2>
<p>Create a simple service to demonstrate AOP.</p>
<h3>Java</h3>
<p>Service</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">package com.example.demo.service;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class UserService {

    public String getUserById(String id) {
        return "User with ID: " + id;
    }

    public String getAllUsers() {
        return "Fetching all users.";
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Kotlin</h3>
<p>Service</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">package com.example.demo.service

import org.springframework.stereotype.Service

@Service

    fun getUserById(id: String): String {
        return "User with ID: $id"
    }

    fun getAllUsers(): String {
        return "Fetching all users."
    }
}
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Step 3: Create an Aspect</h2>
<p>Define an aspect to log method execution details.</p>
<h3>Java</h3>
<p>Aspect</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">package com.example.demo.aspect;

import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Aspect;
import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Before;
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Aspect
@Component
public class LoggingAspect {

    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(LoggingAspect.class);

    @Before("execution(* com.example.demo.service.UserService.*(..))")
    public void logBefore() {
        logger.info("Method execution started.");
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Kotlin</h3>
<p>Aspect</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">package com.example.demo.aspect

import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Aspect
import org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Before
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) simplifies database operations in modern applications. This guide will show you how to set up ORM with PostgreSQL using Spring Boot and the Gin framework.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🌟 Why Use ORM?</h2>
<p>ORM bridges the gap between object-oriented programming and relational databases by mapping objects directly to database tables. This eliminates the need for manual SQL queries, reducing errors and increasing productivity for developers.</p>
<hr>
<h2>📋 Prerequisites</h2>
<p>📋 Ensure you have the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>☕ Java Development Kit (JDK) 17+</li>
<li>📦 Maven or Gradle installed</li>
<li>🖥️ A Java IDE</li>
<li>🐘 PostgreSQL installed and running</li>
</ul>
<p>For Go:</p>
<ul>
<li>🔧 Golang 1.17+ installed</li>
<li>🔄 go.mod initialized in your project</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Step 1: Add Dependencies</h2>
<p>To set up a Spring Boot project and integrate ORM, follow these steps:</p>
<h3>Add Dependencies</h3>
<p>For Spring Boot projects, include the following dependencies in your project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maven:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&#x3C;dependency>
  &#x3C;groupId>org.springframework.boot&#x3C;/groupId>
  &#x3C;artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-jpa&#x3C;/artifactId>
&#x3C;/dependency>
&#x3C;dependency>
  &#x3C;groupId>org.postgresql&#x3C;/groupId>
  &#x3C;artifactId>postgresql&#x3C;/artifactId>
&#x3C;/dependency>
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Gradle:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-groovy">implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-data-jpa'
implementation 'org.postgresql:postgresql'
</code></pre>
<h3>Configure the Database</h3>
<p>Set up your PostgreSQL connection in the <code>application.properties</code> or <code>application.yml</code> file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-properties">spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/demo
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
</code></pre>
<h3>Initialize the Project</h3>
<p>If you haven't already, create your Spring Boot project using <a href="https://start.spring.io/">Spring Initializr</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, and PostgreSQL Driver as dependencies.</li>
<li>Download the project and import it into your preferred IDE.</li>
</ol>
<p>For Go projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install Gin Framework and GORM:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># Install the Gin framework
go get -u github.com/gin-gonic/gin

# Install the GORM PostgreSQL driver
go get -u gorm.io/driver/postgres

# Install the GORM ORM library
go get -u gorm.io/gorm
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Step 2: Define the Model and Implement the REST Controller</h2>
<p>This step combines creating the entity/model, repository, and REST controllers.</p>
<h3>Java</h3>
<p>Entity</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">package com.example.demo.entity;

import jakarta.persistence.*;
import lombok.Data;

@Data
@Entity
public class User {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String name;

    private String email;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Repository</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">package com.example.demo.repository;

import com.example.demo.entity.User;
import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;

public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository&#x3C;User, Long> {
}
</code></pre>
<p>REST Controller</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">package com.example.demo.controller;

import com.example.demo.entity.User;
import com.example.demo.repository.UserRepository;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

import java.util.List;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/users")
import lombok.RequiredArgsConstructor;

@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class UserController {

  private final UserRepository userRepository;

  @GetMapping
  public List&#x3C;User> getAllUsers() {
    return userRepository.findAll();
  }

  @PostMapping
  public User createUser(@RequestBody User user) {
    return userRepository.save(user);
  }
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Kotlin</h3>
<p>Entity</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">package com.example.demo.entity

import jakarta.persistence.*

@Entity
class User(
  @Id
  @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
  val id: Long = 0,

  var name: String,

  var email: String
)
</code></pre>
<p>Repository</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">package com.example.demo.repository

import com.example.demo.entity.User
import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository

interface UserRepository : JpaRepository&#x3C;User, Long>
</code></pre>
<p>REST Controller</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">package com.example.demo.controller

import com.example.demo.entity.User
import com.example.demo.repository.UserRepository
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/users")
class UserController(
  private val userRepository: UserRepository
) {

  @GetMapping
  fun getAllUsers(): List&#x3C;User> = userRepository.findAll()

  @PostMapping
  fun createUser(@RequestBody user: User): User = userRepository.save(user)
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Go</h3>
<p>Model and Database Connection</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">package main

import (
	"gorm.io/driver/postgres"
	"gorm.io/gorm"
)

var DB *gorm.DB

func connectDatabase() {
	dsn := "host=localhost user=your_username password=your_password dbname=demo port=5432 sslmode=disable"
	db, err := gorm.Open(postgres.Open(dsn), &#x26;gorm.Config{})
	if err != nil {
		panic("Failed to connect to database!")
	}

	DB = db
	DB.AutoMigrate(&#x26;User{})
}

type User struct {
	ID    uint   `json:"id" gorm:"primaryKey"`
	Name  string `json:"name"`
	Email string `json:"email"`
}
</code></pre>
<p>Handlers</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">package main

import (
	"github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
)

func getUsers(c *gin.Context) {
	var users []User
	DB.Find(&#x26;users)
	c.JSON(200, users)
}

func createUser(c *gin.Context) {
	var user User
	if err := c.ShouldBindJSON(&#x26;user); err != nil {
		c.JSON(400, gin.H{"error": err.Error()})
		return
	}
	DB.Create(&#x26;user)
	c.JSON(201, user)
}

func main() {
	r := gin.Default()
	connectDatabase()

	r.GET("/api/users", getUsers)
	r.POST("/api/users", createUser)

	r.Run() // Listen and serve on 0.0.0.0:8080
}
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>▶️ Running the Applications</h2>
<p>In this section, we clarify Running the Applications and summarize the key points you will apply in implementation.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Spring Boot:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gin:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">go run main.go
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>🧪 Testing with cURL</h2>
<p>You can test the API using the following cURL commands:</p>
<p>Fetch All Users:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/users
</code></pre>
<p>Create a New User:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/users \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"name": "John Doe", "email": "johndoe@example.com"}'
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>🏁 Conclusion</h2>
<p>You now have a practical Object-Relational Mapping implementation with a clear, production-friendly Spring Boot structure. As a next step, adapt configuration and tests to your own domain, then validate behavior under realistic traffic and failure scenarios.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://suaybsimsek.com/en/posts/rest-api-input-validation</guid>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Input validation is crucial for building secure and robust REST APIs. In this article, we will explore how to implement input validation in Spring Boot using Java, Kotlin, and Go (with Gin).</p>
<hr>
<h2>🌟 Why Validate Input?</h2>
<p>Validation ensures the data sent to your API adheres to expected formats and prevents potential vulnerabilities like SQL Injection, XSS, and bad data entries.</p>
<hr>
<h2>📋 Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Before implementing validation, make sure you have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Java 17+ for Spring Boot examples</li>
<li>Go 1.21+ for Gin examples</li>
<li>A running Spring Boot or Gin starter project</li>
<li>Basic familiarity with DTOs, JSON payloads, and HTTP status codes</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>🧪 Step 1: Add Validation Dependencies</h2>
<p>For Spring Boot projects, include the following dependencies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maven:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&#x3C;dependency>
  &#x3C;groupId>org.springframework.boot&#x3C;/groupId>
  &#x3C;artifactId>spring-boot-starter-validation&#x3C;/artifactId>
&#x3C;/dependency>
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Gradle:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-groovy">implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-validation'
</code></pre>
<p>For Go projects with Gin, use the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># Install the Gin framework
go get -u github.com/gin-gonic/gin

# Install the validator package
go get -u github.com/go-playground/validator/v10
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>🧪 Step 2: Define a DTO with Validation Rules</h2>
<p>Use annotations to define validation constraints on fields. Examples include <code>@NotNull</code>, <code>@Size</code>, and <code>@Pattern</code>.</p>
<h3>Java</h3>
<pre><code class="language-java">package com.example.demo.dto;

import jakarta.validation.constraints.NotNull;
import jakarta.validation.constraints.Size;
import lombok.Data;

@Data
public class TodoRequest {

    @NotNull(message = "Title is required")
    @Size(min = 3, max = 50, message = "Title must be between 3 and 50 characters")
    private String title;

    private boolean completed;
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Kotlin</h3>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">package com.example.demo.dto

import jakarta.validation.constraints.NotNull
import jakarta.validation.constraints.Size

data class TodoRequest(
    @field:NotNull(message = "Title is required")
    @field:Size(min = 3, max = 50, message = "Title must be between 3 and 50 characters")
    val title: String?,

    val completed: Boolean = false
)
</code></pre>
<h3>Go</h3>
<pre><code class="language-go">package dto

import (
    "github.com/go-playground/validator/v10"
)

type TodoRequest struct {
    Title     string `validate:"required,min=3,max=50"`
    Completed bool   `validate:""`
}

var validate = validator.New()

func ValidateTodoRequest(todo TodoRequest) error {
    return validate.Struct(todo)
}
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>🧪 Step 3: Create a Controller with Validation</h2>
<p>Integrate validation into your REST endpoints.</p>
<h3>Java</h3>
<pre><code class="language-java">package com.example.demo.controller;

import com.example.demo.dto.TodoRequest;
import org.springframework.validation.annotation.Validated;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/todos")
public class TodoController {

    @PostMapping
    public String createTodo(@Validated @RequestBody TodoRequest request) {
        return "Todo created: " + request.getTitle();
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Kotlin</h3>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">package com.example.demo.controller

import com.example.demo.dto.TodoRequest
import org.springframework.validation.annotation.Validated
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/todos")
class TodoController {

    @PostMapping
    fun createTodo(@Validated @RequestBody request: TodoRequest): String {
        return "Todo created: ${request.title}"
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Go</h3>
<pre><code class="language-go">package controller

import (
    "dto"
    "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
    "net/http"
)

func CreateTodoHandler(c *gin.Context) {
    var todo dto.TodoRequest

    if err := c.ShouldBindJSON(&#x26;todo); err != nil {
        c.JSON(http.StatusBadRequest, gin.H{"error": err.Error()})
        return
    }

    if err := dto.ValidateTodoRequest(todo); err != nil {
        c.JSON(http.StatusBadRequest, gin.H{"error": err.Error()})
        return
    }

    c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{"message": "Todo created", "title": todo.Title})
}
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>🧪 Step 4: Handle Validation Errors</h2>
<p>Customize error handling to return user-friendly responses.</p>
<h3>Java</h3>
<pre><code class="language-java">package com.example.demo.exception;

import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ExceptionHandler;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestControllerAdvice;
import org.springframework.web.bind.MethodArgumentNotValidException;

import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

@RestControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler {

    @ExceptionHandler(MethodArgumentNotValidException.class)
    public Map&#x3C;String, String> handleValidationExceptions(MethodArgumentNotValidException ex) {
        Map&#x3C;String, String> errors = new HashMap&#x3C;>();
        ex.getBindingResult().getFieldErrors().forEach(error -> errors.put(error.getField(), error.getDefaultMessage()));
        return errors;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Kotlin</h3>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">package com.example.demo.exception

import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ExceptionHandler
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestControllerAdvice
import org.springframework.web.bind.MethodArgumentNotValidException

@RestControllerAdvice
class GlobalExceptionHandler {

    @ExceptionHandler(MethodArgumentNotValidException::class)
    fun handleValidationExceptions(ex: MethodArgumentNotValidException): Map&#x3C;String, String> {
        return ex.bindingResult.fieldErrors.associate { it.field to it.defaultMessage.orEmpty() }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Go</h3>
<pre><code class="language-go">package middleware

import (
    "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
    "net/http"
)

func ErrorHandler() gin.HandlerFunc {
    return func(c *gin.Context) {
        c.Next()

        if len(c.Errors) > 0 {
            c.JSON(http.StatusBadRequest, gin.H{"errors": c.Errors.JSON()})
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<hr>
<p>main.go Example</p>
<p>Here is an example of the <code>main.go</code> file for setting up a Gin application:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">package main

import (
	"controller"
	"github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
)

func main() {
	r := gin.Default()

	r.POST("/api/todos", controller.CreateTodoHandler)

	r.Run() // Start the server on http://localhost:8080
}
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>▶️ Step 5: Run the Application</h2>
<p>To run the application:</p>
<p>Spring Boot (Java/Kotlin):
Run the Spring Boot application from your IDE or terminal:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">./mvnw spring-boot:run # For Maven projects
./gradlew bootRun       # For Gradle projects
</code></pre>
<p>Access the API at <code>http://localhost:8080/api/todos</code>.</p>
<h3>Gin (Go)</h3>
<p>Run the Go application:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">go run main.go
</code></pre>
<p>Access the API at <code>http://localhost:8080/api/todos</code>.</p>
<h2>🧪 Testing with cURL</h2>
<p>Here are some example cURL commands to test the API:</p>
<ul>
<li>POST a new Todo:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-bash">curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/todos \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"title": "New Task", "completed": false}'
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>GET all Todos:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-bash">curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/todos
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Handle Validation Errors:</li>
</ul>
<p>Send an invalid request:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/todos \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"title": ""}'
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>🏁 Conclusion</h2>
<p>You now have a practical Input Validation in REST APIs implementation with a clear, production-friendly Spring Boot structure. As a next step, adapt configuration and tests to your own domain, then validate behavior under realistic traffic and failure scenarios.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spring for GraphQL simplifies the development of GraphQL APIs by integrating with Spring Boot. This guide demonstrates how to create a GraphQL API using Java and Kotlin, with examples for schema definition, query handling, and dependency injection.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🌟 Why Use GraphQL?</h2>
<p>GraphQL allows clients to request specific data, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching compared to REST. It also supports strong typing and facilitates efficient data fetching, making it a popular choice for modern APIs.</p>
<hr>
<h2>📋 Prerequisites</h2>
<p>📋 Ensure you have the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>☕ Java Development Kit (JDK) 17+</li>
<li>📦 Maven or Gradle installed</li>
<li>🔤 A Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Step 1: Add Dependencies</h2>
<p>Include the following dependencies in your project to enable Spring for GraphQL.</p>
<p>Maven:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&#x3C;dependency>
  &#x3C;groupId>org.springframework.boot&#x3C;/groupId>
  &#x3C;artifactId>spring-boot-starter-graphql&#x3C;/artifactId>
&#x3C;/dependency>
</code></pre>
<p>Gradle:</p>
<pre><code class="language-groovy">implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-graphql'
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Step 2: Define the GraphQL Schema</h2>
<p>Create a schema file named <code>schema.graphqls</code> under the <code>src/main/resources/graphql</code> directory.</p>
<pre><code class="language-graphql">type Query {
  getUser(id: ID!): User
  getUsers: [User]
}

type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  email: String!
}
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Step 3: Implement the Data Model and Services</h2>
<p>Define the data model and service layer for handling queries.</p>
<h3>Java</h3>
<p>Entity</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">package com.example.demo.model;

import lombok.AllArgsConstructor;
import lombok.Data;
import lombok.NoArgsConstructor;

@Data
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
public class User {
    private String id;
    private String name;
    private String email;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Service</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">package com.example.demo.service;

import com.example.demo.model.User;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;
import java.util.stream.Stream;

@Service
public class UserService {

    private final Map&#x3C;String, User> userData = Stream.of(
        new User("1", "Alice", "alice@example.com"),
        new User("2", "Bob", "bob@example.com")
    ).collect(Collectors.toMap(User::getId, user -> user));

    public User getUser(String id) {
        return userData.get(id);
    }

    public List&#x3C;User> getUsers() {
        return List.copyOf(userData.values());
    }
}
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h3>Kotlin</h3>
<p>Entity</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">package com.example.demo.model

data class User(
    val id: String,
    val name: String,
    val email: String
)
</code></pre>
<p>Service</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">package com.example.demo.service

import com.example.demo.model.User
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service

@Service
class UserService {

    private val userData = mapOf(
        "1" to User("1", "Alice", "alice@example.com"),
        "2" to User("2", "Bob", "bob@example.com")
    )

    fun getUser(id: String): User? = userData[id]

    fun getUsers(): List&#x3C;User> = userData.values.toList()
}
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Step 4: Implement GraphQL Controllers</h2>
<p>Controllers handle GraphQL queries and mutations. Use the <code>@Controller</code> annotation in Spring for GraphQL.</p>
<h3>Java</h3>
<pre><code class="language-java">package com.example.demo.controller;

import com.example.demo.model.User;
import com.example.demo.service.UserService;
import lombok.RequiredArgsConstructor;
import org.springframework.graphql.data.method.annotation.QueryMapping;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;

import java.util.List;

@Controller
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class UserController {

    private final UserService userService;

    @QueryMapping
    public User getUser(String id) {
        return userService.getUser(id);
    }

    @QueryMapping
    public List&#x3C;User> getUsers() {
        return userService.getUsers();
    }
}
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h3>Kotlin</h3>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">package com.example.demo.controller

import com.example.demo.model.User
import com.example.demo.service.UserService
import org.springframework.graphql.data.method.annotation.QueryMapping
import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller

@Controller
class UserController(
    private val userService: UserService
) {

    @QueryMapping
    fun getUser(id: String): User? = userService.getUser(id)

    @QueryMapping
    fun getUsers(): List&#x3C;User> = userService.getUsers()
}
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>▶️ Running the Application</h2>
<p>Run the application using the following commands:</p>
<p>Spring Boot (Java/Kotlin):
Run the application with either stack to confirm the baseline setup is working before deeper tests.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code></pre>
<p>Access the GraphQL Playground at <code>http://localhost:8080/graphiql</code> to test your API.</p>

<h2>🧪 Testing the GraphQL API</h2>
<p>Here are some example queries to test your API:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fetch a user by ID:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-graphql">query {
  getUser(id: "1") {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Fetch all users:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-graphql">query {
  getUsers {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
</code></pre>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spring Boot is an excellent tool for quickly developing RESTful web services. In this article, we’ll walk through creating a REST API step by step using Spring Boot.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🌟 What is a REST API?</h2>
<p>REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing web services. It uses standard HTTP methods for communication between clients and servers.</p>
<h3>HTTP Methods</h3>
<p>In this subsection, we frame HTTP Methods with concise context so the next example is easier to follow.</p>






























<table><thead><tr><th>Method</th><th>Description</th><th>Example Endpoint</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>GET</td><td>Retrieves a resource.</td><td><code>/api/todos</code></td></tr><tr><td>POST</td><td>Creates a new resource.</td><td><code>/api/todos</code></td></tr><tr><td>PUT</td><td>Updates or creates a resource.</td><td><code>/api/todos/1</code></td></tr><tr><td>DELETE</td><td>Deletes a resource.</td><td><code>/api/todos/1</code></td></tr></tbody></table>
<hr>
<h2>📋 Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Before you start, make sure the following are ready:</p>
<ul>
<li>Java 17+</li>
<li>Maven or Gradle</li>
<li>An IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code)</li>
<li>Basic familiarity with HTTP methods and JSON payloads</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Step 1: Create a Project</h2>
<p>You can create a Spring Boot project using <a href="https://start.spring.io/">Spring Initializr</a>. Select the following settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Project: Maven</li>
<li>Language: Java or Kotlin</li>
<li>Spring Boot Version: 3.0.0+</li>
<li>Dependencies: Spring Web, Spring Boot DevTools, Lombok</li>
</ul>
<p>Download the project, open it in your IDE, and get ready to run it.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Step 2: Create a Model Class</h2>
<p>Create a model class for a <code>Todo</code> object:</p>
<h3>Java</h3>
<pre><code class="language-java">package com.example.demo.model;

import lombok.Data;

@Data
public class Todo {
    private Long id;
    private String title;
    private boolean completed;
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Kotlin</h3>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">package com.example.demo.model

data class Todo(
    var id: Long,
    var title: String,
    var completed: Boolean
)
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>🛠️ Step 3: Create a Controller Class</h2>
<p>Add a <code>TodoController</code> class to define CRUD operations as REST endpoints:</p>
<h3>Java</h3>
<pre><code class="language-java">package com.example.demo.controller;

import com.example.demo.model.Todo;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/todos")
public class TodoController {

    private List&#x3C;Todo> todos = new ArrayList&#x3C;>();

    @GetMapping
    public List&#x3C;Todo> getAllTodos() {
        return todos;
    }

    @PostMapping
    public Todo createTodo(@RequestBody Todo todo) {
        todo.setId((long) (todos.size() + 1));
        todos.add(todo);
        return todo;
    }

    @PutMapping("/{id}")
    public Todo updateTodo(@PathVariable Long id, @RequestBody Todo updatedTodo) {
        Todo todo = todos.stream().filter(t -> t.getId().equals(id)).findFirst().orElse(null);
        if (todo != null) {
            todo.setTitle(updatedTodo.getTitle());
            todo.setCompleted(updatedTodo.isCompleted());
        }
        return todo;
    }

    @DeleteMapping("/{id}")
    public void deleteTodo(@PathVariable Long id) {
        todos.removeIf(todo -> todo.getId().equals(id));
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Kotlin</h3>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">package com.example.demo.controller

import com.example.demo.model.Todo
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/todos")
class TodoController {

    private val todos = mutableListOf&#x3C;Todo>()

    @GetMapping
    fun getAllTodos(): List&#x3C;Todo> = todos

    @PostMapping
    fun createTodo(@RequestBody todo: Todo): Todo {
        todo.id = (todos.size + 1).toLong()
        todos.add(todo)
        return todo
    }

    @PutMapping("/{id}")
    fun updateTodo(@PathVariable id: Long, @RequestBody updatedTodo: Todo): Todo? {
        val todo = todos.find { it.id == id }
        todo?.apply {
            title = updatedTodo.title
            completed = updatedTodo.completed
        }
        return todo
    }

    @DeleteMapping("/{id}")
    fun deleteTodo(@PathVariable id: Long) {
        todos.removeIf { it.id == id }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>🧪 Step 4: Test the API</h2>
<p>Test your API using <code>curl</code> commands:</p>
<ul>
<li>GET All Todos:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-bash">curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/todos
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>POST New Todo:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-bash">curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/todos -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title": "New Todo", "completed": false}'
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>PUT Update Todo:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-bash">curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/api/todos/1 -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title": "Updated Todo", "completed": true}'
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>DELETE Delete Todo:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-bash">curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/todos/1
</code></pre>
<hr>
