        "item1": "Short rounds (1-3 minutes) usually work better than long sessions when your goal is consistency and focus.",
        "item2": "If your eyes feel tired, stop and take a short break before the next round.",

        "body2": "Research on attention and cognitive training is more nuanced than many productivity claims suggest. Task performance can improve with practice, but transfer to broader cognitive outcomes may be limited or mixed depending on study design and outcome measures.",
