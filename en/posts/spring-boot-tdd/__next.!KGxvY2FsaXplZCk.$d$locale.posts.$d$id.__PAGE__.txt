Test-Driven Development (TDD) helps you build robust applications by writing tests **before** implementing business logic. With Spring Boot, writing unit tests is fast, clean, and efficient.

---

## 🌟 Why Use TDD in Spring Boot?

- **Fail Fast**: Catch issues early during development.
- **Clean Design**: Forces modular, testable code structure.
- **Refactor with Confidence**: Tests serve as a safety net.
- **Documentation**: Tests describe intended behavior clearly.

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

Make sure you have:

- ☕ **JDK 17+** installed
- 📦 **Maven or Gradle**
- 🔤 A Java IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse

---

## 🧪 Step 1: Add Test Dependencies

Add Spring Boot's test starter to your project.

**Maven:**

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-test</artifactId>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

**Gradle:**

```groovy
testImplementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-test'
```

---

## 🧪 Step 2: Write Your First Test

Create a simple unit test **before** implementing the service.

:::tabs
@tab Java [icon=java]

```java
package com.example.tdd;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

class GreetingServiceTest {

    @Test
    void shouldReturnGreetingMessage() {
        GreetingService service = new GreetingService();
        String result = service.greet("World");
        assertEquals("Hello, World!", result);
    }
}
```

@tab Kotlin [icon=kotlin]

```kotlin
package com.example.tdd

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test

class GreetingServiceTest {

    @Test
    fun shouldReturnGreetingMessage() {
        val service = GreetingService()
        val result = service.greet("World")
        assertEquals("Hello, World!", result)
    }
}
```

:::

---

## 🛠️ Step 3: Implement the Service

Now implement the `GreetingService` to pass the test.

:::tabs
@tab Java [icon=java]

```java
package com.example.tdd;

public class GreetingService {
    public String greet(String name) {
        return "Hello, " + name + "!";
    }
}
```

@tab Kotlin [icon=kotlin]

```kotlin
package com.example.tdd

class GreetingService {
    fun greet(name: String): String {
        return "Hello, $name!"
    }
}
```

:::

---

## ▶️ Running the Tests

Use your build tool to run the tests:

```bash
./mvnw test
```

Or with Gradle:

```bash
gradle test
```

You should see the test pass ✅

---

## Refactor and Repeat

Now that your test passes, you can safely refactor your code. TDD is a loop:

1. **Red** – Write a failing test
2. **Green** – Make it pass
3. **Refactor** – Improve the code

---

## 🏁 Conclusion

This setup delivers a robust, production-ready Spring Boot Test-Driven Development solution in Spring Boot, combining best practices, clear structure, and practical examples you can adapt to your own project.
