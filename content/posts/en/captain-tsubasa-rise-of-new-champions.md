Before `Captain Tsubasa 2: World Fighters` arrives, `Captain Tsubasa: Rise of New Champions` remains the modern reference point for what a big-budget Captain Tsubasa console game looks like. It is still the clearest example of how Bandai Namco and Tamsoft translated the series into fast, spectacle-first arcade football.

This article looks at the game from a current editorial angle: what was officially confirmed at launch, what the edition and DLC structure tells us, and why the game still matters if you are revisiting the series today.

## 🌟 Why This Game Still Matters

`Rise of New Champions` was positioned as the first new Captain Tsubasa console game in roughly a decade, and that context still matters. It set the template that later discussions around the franchise continue to reference: anime-faithful presentation, exaggerated super plays, and a clear preference for arcade speed over simulation.

- Official release date on the Bandai Namco Europe page is `August 28, 2020`
- The official page lists `TAMSOFT` as developer and `Arcade` as the genre label
- Platform listing on the official page covers `PlayStation 4`, `Nintendo Switch`, and `Steam`
- The current official page still reflects a sizable edition and DLC footprint, which makes it a useful baseline when comparing later Captain Tsubasa releases

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

This breakdown is written for readers who want a practical picture of `Rise of New Champions` today, not just a launch-day recap.

- Basic familiarity with the `Captain Tsubasa` anime/manga universe
- Interest in anime-styled arcade football rather than realistic football simulation
- Willingness to check edition/store details carefully, because this game’s content rollout extended beyond the base launch package

## 🛠️ Official Facts

Start with the Bandai Namco Europe page. For release date, platform support, and official product framing, it remains the cleanest primary source.

Source links:

- [Bandai Namco Europe - CAPTAIN TSUBASA: RISE OF NEW CHAMPIONS](https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/captain-tsubasa/captain-tsubasa-rise-of-new-champions)
- [Captain Tsubasa Fandom Wiki page](https://captaintsubasa.fandom.com/wiki/Captain_Tsubasa:_Rise_of_New_Champions)
- [Fandom Art gallery](https://captaintsubasa.fandom.com/wiki/Captain_Tsubasa:_Rise_of_New_Champions/Gallery#Art)
- [Fandom Japan gallery reference](https://captaintsubasa.fandom.com/wiki/Captain_Tsubasa:_Rise_of_New_Champions/Gallery#Japan)
- [Official trailer embed on Bandai page (YouTube)](https://youtu.be/WHBQO6tH4Dk)

Confirmed on the official page:

- Title: `CAPTAIN TSUBASA: RISE OF NEW CHAMPIONS`
- Release date: `28/08/2020`
- Developer: `TAMSOFT`
- Genre: `Arcade`
- Platforms shown: `PlayStation 4`, `Nintendo Switch`, `Steam`

The official description also frames the game as the series’ return to consoles after roughly ten years, with an explicit promise of anime spectacle and up-to-date presentation.

---

## 🛠️ Gameplay Pitch

The official key-features section makes the game’s direction very clear: this is not a grounded football sim. It is an anime football action game built around visual impact and fast exchanges.

The official page emphasizes:

- Toon shading combined with more realistic effects
- Detailed presentation for signature character styles
- High-speed “arcade football action”
- Simple controls designed to make special moves and highlight plays accessible

That framing is important because it explains both the game’s appeal and its limits. If you want structured, sim-like football, this is the wrong entry point. If you want exaggerated shots, tackles, rivalries, and momentum swings that feel close to the anime, this is exactly the lane the game targets.

---

## 🛠️ Editions and DLC

One of the most practical things about the current official page is that it still exposes how much post-launch content was attached to the game.

The page shows multiple editions and related content references, including:

- `Champions Edition`
- `Collector's Edition`
- `Deluxe Edition`
- `Legends Edition`
- `New Hero Edition`
- `Character Pass: 9 DLC players`
- `Season Pass Bonus: New Champions Uniform Set`
- `Deluxe Edition Bonus: V Jump Collaboration Uniform Set`

From a player’s perspective, this matters more than marketing nostalgia. If you are buying or replaying the game now, edition structure directly affects how much roster-related and cosmetic content you actually receive.

The official page also still surfaces later DLC/news references such as `EPISODE: RISING STARS`, which shows that the game’s support window expanded well beyond the base launch moment.

---

## 🛠️ Community References

The Fandom page is still useful, especially when you want a single place for roster references, story structure summaries, and archived promotional art. That includes the `Art` and `Japan` gallery sections, which are useful visual references when official media blocks rotate over time.

Use it for:

- Aggregated roster/team references
- Story-mode and character reference browsing
- Archived gallery snapshots and regional cover/art references

Use official sources first for:

- Release date and platform confirmation
- Edition/store metadata
- Current DLC/storefront navigation

The right split is simple: official pages for buying facts, community pages for context and archival browsing.

## ▶️ What to Verify Today

Because this is a 2020 release with layered editions and DLC, the key questions today are not the same as they were at launch.

Check these points first:

1. Which edition is actually available on your preferred platform today
2. Whether the `Character Pass` or later DLC content is bundled or separate
3. Whether you want the game mainly for arcade match play, series presentation, or collection value
4. Whether the platform you are considering (`PS4`, `Switch`, or `Steam`) is the one you actually want to play long-term

If your goal is to understand the modern Captain Tsubasa console formula before `World Fighters`, this game still does that job well. If your goal is simply to own the most complete package, edition details matter enough that you should not treat storefront listings as interchangeable.

## 🏁 Conclusion

`Captain Tsubasa: Rise of New Champions` is still the clearest modern template for the franchise’s console direction before `World Fighters`: aggressive arcade pacing, anime-faithful spectacle, and a product structure shaped heavily by editions and DLC. If you are revisiting the series now, the smartest move is to verify edition contents first, then decide whether you want this game as a playable entry point, a collection piece, or a baseline for comparing the next Captain Tsubasa release.
