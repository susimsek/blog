In this guide, we‚Äôll walk through creating your first Gin application step by step.\n\n---\n\n## üåü Prerequisites\n\nüìã Before starting, ensure you have the following:\n\n- üîß **Golang** 1.17+ installed\n- üóç **A text editor or IDE** (e.g., Visual Studio Code, GoLand, or Vim)\n\n---\n\n## üõ†Ô∏è Step 1: Set Up Your Gin Project\n\nYou can set up your first Gin project by following these steps:\n\n1. **Initialize a Go Module**\n\n```bash\nmkdir gin-first-app\ncd gin-first-app\ngo mod init gin-first-app\n```\n\n2. **Install Gin**\n\n```bash\ngo get -u github.com/gin-gonic/gin\n```\n\n---\n\n## üìñ Step 2: Writing Your First Endpoint\n\nLet‚Äôs write a simple endpoint to say hello:\n\nCreate a file named `main.go` with the following content:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"github.com/gin-gonic/gin\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\tr := gin.Default()\n\n\tr.GET(\"/hello\", func(c *gin.Context) {\n\t\tc.JSON(200, gin.H{\n\t\t\t\"message\": \"Hello, Gin!\",\n\t\t})\n\t})\n\n\tr.Run() // Listen and serve on 0.0.0.0:8080\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Step 3: Run the Application\n\n1. Open a terminal in the project folder.\n2. Execute the following command to run your application:\n\n```bash\ngo run main.go\n```\n\n3. Access the endpoint at:\n   ```\n   http://localhost:8080/hello\n   ```\n\n**Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"message\": \"Hello, Gin!\"\n}\n```\n\n---\n\nThis post covers the basics of creating a Gin project, writing an endpoint, and running it successfully.\n","id":"golang-gin-first-application","title":"Gin - First Application","date":"2024-12-14","summary":"A beginner-friendly guide to creating your first Golang Gin application from scratch.
